{"content": "This was the year that felt like 50 years. We lost sleep. We woke up disoriented. We embraced comfort food and drink. We did everything we could to look away from The Trump Show, and yet, we often found ourselves unable to stop scrolling. We felt beaten down but never quite beaten, not all the way. We protested. We resisted. We stopped putting up with the same old bullsh*t. What follows are 21 stories\u2014out of the thousands we published in print and online\u2014that particularly resonated with our readers over these past 12 months. They're stories about love, death, politics, race, food, fighting, women, men. They're stories about how we present ourselves to the outside world and stories about who we are behind closed doors. We leave 2017 exhausted but invigorated; still optimistic for greater change. We'll keep telling more stories, and we're grateful that you'll keep reading them.Kate's Still HereDeloy Oberlin didn't know how much time his wife had left, but he knew he wanted to spend their final days together fulfilling her last wish.by Libby Copeland\nFor three days during a humid stretch of July in Newton, North Carolina, cars lined up along the dirt road outside the home of Deloy and Kate Oberlin.Musicians and farmers and doctors came, and friends and family and neighbors. They showed up with their hands full. They carried homemade chicken potpie and sweet potato casserole and tamales and apple cake. They carried fiddles and banjos, a bass, a dulcimer, and a six-string guitar. They brought girls in fancy dresses and a boy holding a fidget spinner. They walked in the door and admired the family pictures along the hall, and hugged Deloy, and asked how he was doing.\u201cCome visit Kate,\u201d he\u2019d tell them.Bill Maher Knows Exactly What He's DoingJust ask him. by Stephen Rodrick\nA few weeks before Bill Maher nearly blew up his career for the second time, a middle-aged man named Billy Martin warmed up the audience that had come to watch a filming of Real Time with Bill Maher. Martin, Maher's head writer, stood on the L.A. soundstage where Real Time is broadcast live on Friday nights, the same one used by The Price Is Right. He asked if there were any conservatives in the audience, which skewed white and rowdy. A guy in a Tommy Bahama\u2013style shirt raised his hand.\"How was the drive up from Orange County?\" Martin asked.The crowd laughed, unaware that Martin would use the same joke the next week. He finished his routine by urging a standing ovation for Maher, who blew a kiss to the audience as he moved toward his mark on the stage.The Untold Stories of Election Day 2016What really happened?by Esquire Editors\nOn November 8, 2016, America's chief storytellers\u2014those within the bubbles of media and politics\u2014lost the narrative they had controlled for decades. In a space of 24 hours, the concept of \"conventional wisdom\" seemed to vanish for good. How did this happen? What follows are over 40 brand new interviews and behind-the-scenes stories from deep inside The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News, and more\u2014plus first-hand accounts from the campaigns, themselves. We've spent a year hearing the spin. Now it's time for the truth.The Bro Romper Exists And I Don't Want to Live on This Planet AnymoreRompHim wants to be the next big thing in menswear.by Christine Flammia\nThere's a lot to thank the bros for in terms of modern menswear. They've brought us boat shoes and fleece vests. They've embraced body confidence in 5.25-inseam shorts. They've even made us rethink what it means to wear a classic gingham shirt. But today, in what might possibly be the bro-iest style move in all of bro style, a new brand launched on Kickstarter that might change the face of menswear: the RompHim.No, it's not a romper. It's a romphim. Well, actually, it is a romper but it's made for dudes. Let's be clear here: We happily invite all people to wear whatever it is that makes them feel like themselves, gender labels be damned. But as a woman who is decidedly anti-romper of any sort, I'm not sure this is a train I'd recommend anybody hopping aboard. Do you have any idea how hard it is to pee in those things? (OK, fine. This one has a zipper fly. But this is still very dangerous territory.)Finding Meaning in The Book of Henry, the Best Worst Movie of the YearAn unnecessarily thorough review of an unnecessary movie.by Dave Holmes\nI just saw The Book of Henry, and I feel like I've been mugged by a Decemberists song. I am confused, annoyed, and exhausted\u2014and that doesn't mean I don't recommend it. I actually want everyone to see The Book of Henry, just so I don't have to be in this club by myself.I will confess I knew nothing about it going in. I had heard the trailer was berserk, but extreme reactions about movie trailers are nothing new. I had come across vague tweets about how bananas the movie was, but everybody knows not to put too much stock in what one hears on Twitter. Still, I was intrigued, and I decided that if I was going in, I was going in blind.The Masochist's MarathonThe world's top ultrarunners fight to compete in the Barkley Marathons, an ever-shifting race designed by a madman to break their spirits through 100 miles of hellish Appalachian mountains. So far, only 14 people have completed it.by George Pendle\nA man is begging on the side of a Tennessee mountain. He's crumpled on the ground, his clothes are soaking wet, and he's sucking air hard. His wife weeps as she huddles over him, her hands resting softly on his arm. Above them stands a bearded figure in a wide-brimmed hat and a worn-out oilskin duster.\"I got all my pages!\" pleads the man on the ground. His voice is shrill, hysterical. \"I dropped down the wrong side of the mountain in the fog. I had to swim a river.\" He gasps for air again. \"I got all my pages!\"A small group of onlookers cover their mouths and stare. They look from the broken man on the ground to the inscrutable face of the bearded figure looming over him.\"He got all his pages,\" repeats a voice in the crowd. \"He got all his pages.\"How to Know If You've Sent a Bad TweetA deep dive into 'The Ratio.' by Luke O'Neil\nTwitter is a much-maligned, ever-burning furnace of existential dread. At its best, it's an efficient tool for communication, even if that only means telling people to go fuck themselves. But unlike on other forms of social media, where the success of a post might be measured in terms of the discussion it generates\u2014a busy comment section under a blog post, or thousands of comments on a Facebook page\u2014on Twitter, provoking a significant response is actually evidence of the opposite. The lengthier the conversation, the surer it is that someone royally messed up. It's a phenomenon known as The Ratio.A Plea for a PresidentIt is time for Barack Obama to join the Trump Resistance full-time.by Charles P. Pierce\nPlease stop telling us fairy tales about ourselves. Stop worrying about our \u201cdifferences.\u201d There are actual Nazis being empowered all around the world. The conservative project here of simultaneously re-establishing Jim Crow and the Gilded Age, this time for good, is too far along to be fought with fantasies of a great people misled, or visions of good Christians at Little League games in the blue states. I can\u2019t think of any voice of resistance that would resound more deeply, or any voice in defense of civic values that would be more compelling. But, if you\u2019re going to resist, you have to be honest about what you\u2019re resisting, If you\u2019re going to defend something, you have to be honest about what you\u2019re defending it against.Where were you when the women marched? Where were you when scientists marched? Where have you been on Pruitt, on DeVos, on Sessions, or on the endless assaults on your achievements? I know there are rules and norms guiding the deportment of ex-presidents, but it's not really a time to worry about political rules and norms, is it? You called the repeal of your healthcare law (correctly) an \"act of meanness,\" but didn't mention the president* who is in such a jacked-up frenzy to pass it. What the hell is that?How Vans Became the Shoes Everyone's Wearing\u2014AgainIn the early 2000s, the Southern California brand was irrelevant. Now it\u2019s a $2.3 billion global powerhouse worn by pretty much everyone.by Jonathan Evans\nBack in 2002, when Rian Pozzebon, who was then a relative unknown in the sneaker community, got the offer to join Vans and help rebuild the brand\u2019s ailing skate shoe program with his longtime friend and colleague Jon Warren, he had one big question: \u201cWill they let us mess with the classics?\u201dAt the time, Vans wasn\u2019t particularly interested in core models like the Slip-On, Old Skool, and Authentic. \u201cThe classics just kind of existed,\u201d says Pozzebon. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t pushed.\u201d Instead, they languished\u2014in just a few basic colors\u2014in Vans stores.The company's focus was directed elsewhere, on newer styles. After riding the wave of the \u201890s skateboarding boom, Vans faced new competition from younger skate shoe brands like DC and Osiris. These companies\u2014born only a few years earlier\u2014favored a chunkier, more tech-forward silhouette (a word the fashion community uses to describe the shape of a shoe). Vans\u2019 retro styling, by comparison, felt stale. By the early years of the new millennium, nearly a decade of sustained growth had fallen off\u2014as had customers\u2019 goodwill.Why Get Out Is the Best Movie Ever Made About American SlaveryJordan Peele's horror film is about the theft of black bodies\u2014but it isn't set in the Antebellum South.by Steven Thrasher \nGet Out is a kind of taut Universal romp, as if Alfred Hitchcock had finally contemplated the existential terror of race. Get Out is really a masterwork of Afrofuturism, the artistic and scientific framework for understanding race as a technology across time and space. Writer-director Jordan Peele unabashedly uses classical Afrofuturist imagery in depicting the theft of the Black body when his protagonist Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) stumbles from his girlfriend's mother's hypnosis far down into the void of space\u2014 only able to look up at a two dimensional view of his own life and rendered unable to act. A recurring image in Afrofuturism is the Black body abducted by aliens as an allegory for enslavement in different eras and places.In Peele's hands, I found my eyes looking at Chris's floating body and thinking about stolen Africans who were experimented upon (or thrown overboard), Henrietta Lacks' stolen HeLa cells, Emmett Till's little 14-year-old lynched body, music and sports stars being extracted from Black neighborhoods for white profit, the government not treating syphilis in hundreds of Black men in Tuskegee to study them\u2014and, back to Chris, about to be lobotomized.I've Worked in Food for 20 Years. Now You Finally Care About Female Chefs?We deserved your attention long before sexual harassment made headlines.by Amanda Cohen\nMake no mistake about it, I think it\u2019s long overdue that women feel safe enough to come forward and speak about the assault and harassment they experience in restaurants, and I\u2019m glad reporters are holding the perpetrators responsible. This is 100 percent a good thing. But if the press had been as eager to celebrate the talents of female chefs as they are to discuss their victimization, we wouldn\u2019t be in this position in the first place.Women are second-class citizens in the restaurant world. We have less access to investors and are perceived as less profitable investments because, in large part, we have smaller profiles than male chefs. We get nominated for fewer awards, our restaurants get reviewed less often, and we get less press coverage than men.The Secretive Family Making Billions From the Opioid CrisisYou\u2019re aware America is under siege, fighting an opioid crisis that has exploded into a public-health emergency. You\u2019ve heard of OxyContin, the pain medication to which countless patients have become addicted. But do you know that the company that makes Oxy and reaps the billions of dollars in profits it generates is owned by one family?by Christpher GlazekSuperStock; Science History Images/ Alamy\n\n\nTo the extent that the Sacklers have cultivated a reputation, it\u2019s for being earnest healers, judicious stewards of scientific progress, and connoisseurs of old and beautiful things. Few are aware that during the crucial period of OxyContin\u2019s development and promotion, Sackler family members actively led Purdue\u2019s day-to-day affairs, filling the majority of its board slots and supplying top executives. By any assessment, the family\u2019s leaders have pulled off three of the great marketing triumphs of the modern era: The first is selling OxyContin; the second is promoting the Sackler name; and the third is ensuring that, as far as the public is aware, the first and the second have nothing to do with one another.My Dad's Confederate FlagAnd learning to let go of parts of our Southern \"heritage.\"By Trae Crowder\nOne of my favorite pictures I've ever taken is a shot of my late father holding my oldest son, who was only two at the time. Two of the most important people in my life, smiling broadly: a photographic representation of What It's All About. I love that picture ... and I never show it to anyone. Not because I consider it too personal to me, or too painful since my dad passed away. I never show that picture to anyone because it was taken in my dad's bedroom, and behind them in that photo, displayed prominently on my father's wall, hangs the Confederate Battle Flag.The Passion of Daniel Humm, The Greatest Chef in AmericaHow broken bones, a broken heart, and a bizarre hunger for agony got the mysterious Swiss chef to the best restaurant in the country.by Jeff Gordinier \nEat at Eleven Madison Park and a bartender will wheel a cocktail cart alongside your table to make you a manhattan as deftly balanced as Philippe Petit on a tightrope; a snowy globe of celery root will come hot and tender out of an inflated pig's bladder before being bathed in a truffled sauce; a sommelier will open a bottle of wine by firing up a pair of tongs with what looks like a Bunsen burner and then squeezing the hot tongs right below the cork to melt the glass; for dessert, a torrent of blue flame will pour down the white slopes of your Baked Alaska.These acts are performed with an unflappable happiness that can, at times, seem beyond human. To describe the protocol at Eleven Madison Park as \"service with a smile\" is to force it into the company of the flair-wearing fast-casual behemoths. But \"Make It Nice\" is more than just a hashtagged corporate slogan for Guidara and Humm\u2014it's a religion. They take niceness to extremes. A friend of mine once dined at Eleven Madison Park and offhandedly mumbled something about Game of Thrones and mead. Before his meal was over, a cup of mead had been brought to his table. The job of the staff member known as the Dreamweaver is to acquire stray threads of conversation from waitstaff and to act on that information (quickly, before you depart with the customary jar of Humm's handmade granola for the morning after) to make a fantasy come to life. You've always wondered what it would be like if you could return to your apartment on the bare back of a snorting snow-white stallion? Be careful what you wish for.'Repeal and Go Fuck Yourself' Is in Full EffectThe Graham-Cassidy bill is earning the nickname.by Jack HolmesGraham-Cassidy opens a very intentional loophole where states can apply for waiversto change the definition within their borders of what constitutes an Essential Benefit. If, say, Mississippi successfully applies to strike pregnancy from the list of Essential Benefits, then insurance companies in Mississippi can refuse to cover some or all procedures involved in pregnancy, or jack up rates on patients who use those services. It would essentially end these protections in states where insurance companies have sufficient influence over state officials.A host of red states opted out of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion after a Supreme Court decision allowed them to. It was free money from the federal government to start, with a relatively small uptick in state contributions down the line. However, it would also have have been a win for Barack Obama.Kyle MacLachlan Flirts With the DarknessDavid Lynch's most reliable guide reveals that Twin Peaks will never end, because everything is Twin Peaks.by Tyler Coates\nWhat's the allure of Kyle MacLachlan, anyway? There is the obvious handsomeness, an all-American look that the actor attributes to one feature in particular. \"It's the chin,\" he says with a laugh. \"It's hard to get away from that.\" But there's something about his personality, too, that offsets\u2014and maybe works in tandem\u2014with his looks. He has a kind sensibility, an inherent goofiness that makes one naturally comfortable around him. He seems to have heard this before, from people who have tried to describe him without being able to put their finger on it exactly. Back to his face, just for a second: MacLachlan tells me that it's got an edge to it, so he hears, that has served as a trademark of sorts. \"There's something off\u2014that's the thing,\" he says. \"People would always tell me, 'Something about your face is a little bit off.'\" (Writer Rich Cohen once described him, in an early '90s profile in Rolling Stone, as \"the boy next door, if that boy spent lots of time alone in the basement.\") Does he sweat the comments he's received about the indiscernible weirdness of his persona, his face? Not really. \"Listen, if it gets me work, that's fine,\" he says.The Betsy DeVos Hearing Was an Insult to DemocracyWho are the real grizzlies?by Charles P. Pierce\nWASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014It was not a hearing. It was the mere burlesque of a hearing, rendered meaningless by a preposterously accelerated process that rendered all questioning perfunctory and that left all cheap evasions hanging in the air of the committee room the way cigarette smoke used to canopy the proceedings back in the day. You would not hire a gardener through the process by which Betsy DeVos likely is going to become the Secretary of Education. A public school system wouldn't hire her to work the cafeteria line at lunch. It was appalling. It was unnerving. It was a grotesque of how an evolved democracy should operate. It was business as usual these days and it likely isn't going to matter a damn.As nearly as I can tell, the nominees for the president-elect's Cabinet fall into several different categories. There are the people you'd pretty much expect from any Republican administration. (James Mattis, Michael Flynn, Ryan Zinke). There are the people who understand the mission of their departments and have spent their lives undermining it. (Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, Rick Perry at Energy, Andrew Puzder at Labor). And there are the people who are fundamentally clueless about the general nature of public service. (Rex Tillerson at State.) On Tuesday night, DeVos demonstrated that she is that rarest of Trump administration fauna: Someone who fits capably into all three categories.The Best New Restaurants in America, 2017Right now, we just want to break bread with good friends. We don't want gimmicks or concepts. And we don't want to be rushed. What we want is to be transported. And yes, of course we want another great bottle of wine. Because we want to toast the return of real restaurants.by Jeff Gordinier\nRemember restaurants? The ones you keep going back to?Not the places where you have to wait for three hours until someone texts you. Not places where you drop in once, shave off a lump of your retirement savings, and endure five hours of high-concept origami so that you can brag about your accomplishment on Instagram while you make a beeline for Popeyes because you\u2019re still hungry. Not that. Not those. No.In spite of (or maybe because of) all the cultural energy surrounding the food movement of the past fifteen years, a lot of people have forgotten what restaurants are actually for. We\u2019re talking about the restaurants that make you want to become a regular, the ones that lure you back for another round of cacio e pepe or okonomiyaki. The ones where you sit down and order and feel, for a couple hours, happier to be alive than when you first walked in. Those are the spots we\u2019re raising a toast to. The list encompasses the past couple years. Following the writer Josh Ozersky\u2019s death in May 2015, our esteemed annual roster went into dormancy for a while, but it\u2019s back now with (we hope) a spirit of celebratory ravenousness. Acclaimed tasting menus have sprouted up during those years: Single Thread in Sonoma County, Oriole in Chicago, Aska in Brooklyn. As much as we admire them, they\u2019re not on this list. Too often, despite exquisite standards, the tasting-menu format fails to deliver the simple pleasures.To paraphrase an old song, we want to see the bright lights tonight. We want to go out. Are you up for that? If so, these are the very best places in the United States of America to make it happen.57 Things I Need You to Stop Doing to the Women You Work WithI'm begging you: Don't be a creep at work.by Kaitlin Menza\nA female friend of mine went on a foreign business trip early in her career with two colleagues who were both male, married, and senior to her at the company. After dinner with a client, hours after she had retired to her room, around 1 a.m., one of her coworkers knocked on her hotel door and asked if she would come out for a drink. She declined. After another hour, around 2 a.m., the other coworker knocked on her door. When she opened it a crack, he tried to push his way into her room. She fought him off. All three still work together.The narratives blend, as do the euphemisms. That Hollywood executive is a bad apple. That TV host is a monster. That politician uses locker-room talk. It\u2019s the alcohol. It\u2019s the socializing. It\u2019s the clothes. It\u2019s the attitudes. It\u2019s just being in the vicinity of women. It\u2019s the video games, though I haven\u2019t heard that excuse in a while.But the fact is, it\u2019s you. It\u2019s men. The social ill that we can\u2019t quite put our finger on is men.Niall Horan Has a New Look, So Don't @ HimWith a #1 solo record and no more time for Twitter trolls, the One Direction member is redefining what it means to be Niall Horan.by Jonathan Evans\nNiall Horan is not at all sure about the mechanical bull. We\u2019re in the middle of a photo shoot inside storied Texas music hall Gilley\u2019s Dallas\u2014he\u2019s performing tonight; fans have been camping out all week\u2014and our photographer just asked if this member of One Direction, one of the biggest pop acts in the history of pop acts, will climb on for a picture. He eyes the contraption with a look that\u2019s one part curiosity, one part disgust.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this shot, again?\u201d he asks.There\u2019s not really a point, we explain, it\u2019s just something we thought would be fun. You know: Texas! Bulls! Horan still seems dubious. After a few more moments of deliberation, he makes the call to leave the beast be and set off for another location. He\u2019s rolling with the punches, but it\u2019s as if this is the first time anyone has asked him to throw on a bunch of designer clothes and straddle a giant robo-cow simply for the sake of a photograph. Which is fair, because it is.The Girl From PlainvilleCan words kill? Earlier this year, a young woman from a small town in Massachusetts stood trial for homicide. Prosecutors argued that her calls and texts fueled her boyfriend's suicide. The judge's shocking verdict answered the question of whether speech alone was enough to make her guilty in his death, but it left a larger question untouched: What was Michelle Carter thinking?\nThe text messages started the night her son went missing. Lynn Roy saw the first one around ten-thirty on July 12, 2014: \"Do you know where he is?\" She saw the second the next day: \"Did you call the police yet?\" Then a third: \"Any news?\" The sender, Michelle Carter, was familiar to Lynn as a girl her son, Conrad, texted. She guessed they were friends. It turned out Michelle was right to be worried: That afternoon, July 13, police found Conrad in the parking lot of the Kmart on Route 6 in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, asphyxiated by the carbon monoxide from a water pump in the cab of his F-250.", "id": 1, "title": "21 Stories Our Readers Loved in 2017"}	
{"content": "Gary Vaynerchuk once told a 20 year old Taylor about what to do after graduating college. Here\u2019s what he said:\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen in the next 6 years and you gotta accept it. I gave up my entire 20s, all of \u2019em. Imagine not doing anything fun or going anywhere for the next eight years, including Saturday and Sunday. That\u2019s what I did from 22 to 30 . Every day I spent hours a day in a liquor store, thought about a liquor store, built a liquor store, sold wine. Like spent every day. Like this last weekend, don\u2019t lie to me Taylor, what did you do this last weekend? What did you do fuckin\u2019 Saturday and Sunday? Tell me the truth, don\u2019t bullshit me.\u201dNo bullshit Gary. I just turned 27. Last Saturday and Sunday, I was surfing in Bali and drinking Old Fashioneds and coconuts.I absolutely love Gary V\u2019s advice in general to work hard, but I couldn\u2019t disagree more with his advice on what to do after graduating college.I\u2019m four years removed from graduating college and have had the most fun I\u2019ve ever traveling the world, pursing any passion that came my way, all while building a seven figure business. I spent my weekends partying, exploring, attending festivals and diving to the depths of the oceans. And I\u2019m not bullshitting you.To me, if you have to \u2018sacrifice\u2019 your twenties, some of the most fun years of your life to build a successful business \u2014 then it ain\u2019t worth it. I\u2019m here to show you how you can have the best of both worlds. How you can get there faster, better while you are enjoying your life to its fullest.You might be thinking that I had some special advantage or a family business to catapult off off, but the truth is that\u2026 well that just isn\u2019t the case.I grew up being raised by a single parent mother on welfare. After graduating college, I spent the entire summer playing Diablo III and making tacos because I had been rejected from everything else including medical school, Fulbright, Princeton in Asia and more.I started my business while living on a couch and working at Q\u2019s Billiard Bar in Westwood, Los Angeles as a bus boy making $7/hour. I\u2019m far from naturally being super smart or anything.Gary V spent 8 years of his prime in his twenties selling wine in a liquor store. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to. If someone were to give you a Rubiks cube and tell you to solve it, isn\u2019t it easier to get a bit of direction and strategy from someone who has done it already than to try to figure it out from scratch? Especially if that Rubiks cube is a ticking clock like your life which can\u2019t just be reset.Over the years I\u2019ve learned a lot through trial and error.I want to share with you how you can start off on the right track with a great plan to achieve and live the life that most dream of.Here\u2019s what you should do after graduating college:1. Figure out what you are good at.People pay you for your skills. When someone hires you for a job, they are paying you for a skill that they can\u2019t do or don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s why it is so important to know what your strengths are in order to make a living, to build a business, or to just be happy in general.This will also help you start to find things you are passionate about, or potentially will be passionate about. Too many people say \u2018do what you are passionate about\u2019 they forget to tell you that things you are passionate about sometimes must be found.I just know there are certain things that I\u2019m just not good at, and being worse than everyone else always just isn\u2019t fun. Having a good starting off point and being good at something builds your confidence and allows you to start becoming passionate about something.You tend to become passionate at stuff that you are good at.You might hear that people say that you should take risks and fail. Then let that guide you. I can tell you right how, I don\u2019t have to fail to figure out that I\u2019m not good at drawing. I don\u2019t need my self esteem to take a hit to realize that. Don\u2019t get used to failing. I like winning, not failing.Therefore, you must know what your strengths are. If your strengths are being outgoing and speaking to people, then you\u2019re probably an extrovert and will excel at building connections, sales and networking. If you\u2019re creative and already have an artistic background, then make a note of that because you\u2019re going to be able to turn these strengths eventually into money.2. Narrow the list of what you\u2019re good at down into things that you aren\u2019t starting with a huge disadvantage.How do you do this? Just ask yourself the question, if I spent a year or so really developing this skillset, are there still going to be a lot of people just simply better than I am because they started earlier or just have a stronger background?For example, early on I knew I was good at computers. I played a lot of computer games and I was technically literate. I thought about learning how to be a developer.Then I realized\u2026 even if I spent a year or two, every single day learning how to be a great developer, the end result would still be that there are tens of thousands of people in India that are just going to be better than I am because they have 10 years of experience on me. And due to cost of living, they\u2019re willing to get paid a fraction of what I would like to. I\u2019m fighting an uphill battle that I\u2019m not going to win.Then I realized, what if I pivot those skills? I started researching and found out about SEO (Search Engine Optimization) just by talking to a friend\u2019s Dad. He explained the basics, and told me that I didn\u2019t have to be a developer to do that. I just needed to have a basic understand of how websites work. That was the beginnings to my journey in building a 7 figure business.However, you should take this advice with a grain of salt. Some skill sets don\u2019t need as much deep training to actually be pretty good at it. For example, if you\u2019re already a great artist, it probably wouldn\u2019t take much to be able to transfer those skill sets into being a pretty good graphic designer.3. Start learning even if it means working for free or for little money.You\u2019re going to need to start somewhere. Buy books or online courses on Udemy.com depending on what you\u2019re interested in. Elon Musk first learned how to start a rocket ship company from reading books. Granted, he had a background in physics, which served as a good foundation as mentioned earlier. You can find most things for free. Experience is something that is harder to get.Upwork.com is another great place to test your skills as a freelancer where you will be able to find other people that are hiring your skillset, or selling the same skillset. Right now, it isn\u2019t about making money, it\u2019s about building your skill sets as fast as you can.Your one hour of time is always going to worth one hour of time. But how much you get paid in that one hour changes dependent on how good you are at what you do. In the beginning you might just make minimum wage to have opportunities to learn. Then, from there you can start to charge more based on the value you deliver.In short, your hours in a day are finite. The amount you can charge or make per hour is infinite. Focus on the latter.While you do this, live at home and find another a job just to save up a little bit of money. Be humble, you\u2019re not better than any job. Don\u2019t worry about paying back your student loans right now. Your time is more important. In just a few months you should be able to have saved up a chunk of money, and be able to grow your skillset enough to make some money online through Upwork.com or somewhere else.4. Travel.Take the money you\u2019ve saved, even a few thousand dollars is enough. Go travel alone. Go somewhere that makes you nervous, that brings you out of your comfort zone. If you haven\u2019t traveled before, I recommend you go to Southeast Asia where you will learn so much and not break the bank while you\u2019re doing it.The reason travel is important is because you expose yourself to different perspectives. You meet people that give you new ideas that are different from what you know. You\u2019ll see how other people are living their lives whether it be locals, or other travelers. You will be exposing yourself to new ideas, new insights, and skills.Traveling alone also lets you step out of your comfort zone and gives you a lot of time for yourself to think and be on your own schedule. You\u2019re not going to have friends pressuring you to party, to go out, to drink, or to do things that you might not want to do. You only have yourself and a world of friends to meet and share new experiences with.Perhaps most importantly though, is the fact that you will realize something. You will realize that you have already won the fucking jackpot. You can go traveling and enter someone else\u2019s world and then check out when you want to go back to your first world home.You will realize that if you\u2019re too scared to take a risk with your career, then you\u2019re delusional. You\u2019ll realize that the people that came before you (e.g your parents), worked their ass off just to create a life of opportunity for you. America is a land of immigrants. Prior to immigrating to the United States, my parents endured the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, a famine that killed up to 55 million in order to give me an opportunity to live a better life.During my travels, I\u2019ve been told countless times by normal people in various countries the same thing:\u201cIt is my life dream to go to America.\u201dYet so often we are too scared to go and DO what we want to do when there is no better opportunity and insurance than now? You will realize that even if you absolutely fail, make no money, go broke, the WORST case scenario for most of us is that you just go live with your parents again and save up some money to try again. Not to mention you just traveled the world, made a lot of friends, and exposed yourself to a new perspective on life.So what\u2019s holding you back?5. Do 10% more.This isn\u2019t a rule that just applies to what you should do after you graduate college. It\u2019s a rule of thumb of for every aspect of your life.Whatever you do, once you feel like you\u2019ve done enough, just go a little further and do 10% more. This extra 10% will set you apart from the other 90% of people.Why?The reason is because the vast majority of people try to get through life trying to do the bare minimum. The people who decide to go above and beyond when they don\u2019t need to are the ones that end up standing out from the crowd.In your career, just try to deliver 10% more value than others. Spend 10% more time learning your craft.In your fitness goals, when you\u2019re getting fatigued, just try to do 10% more.In your relationships, try to go out of your way an extra 10% to make someone happy.You\u2019ll start becoming someone who will stand out and be different than others.Eventually this 10% will start to compound and that will be your new baseline.If you ever have questions, comments, or just want to chat, drop me a message feel free to email me at dominic@whyyounodoctor.com.

{"content": "On this episode of Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, the former CEO of Groupon, Andrew Mason, chats with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher and The Verge\u2019s Casey Newton about his new company, Descript. The three discuss how his three companies \u2014 Groupon, Detour and Descript \u2014 are nothing like one another and why now is the perfect time for a text-to-audio service. Plus, be sure to stick around for the part where Mason tries to give Michael Bloomberg a horse.\n\nYou can read some of the highlights here, or listen to the entire interview in the audio player below. We\u2019ve also provided a lightly edited complete transcript of their conversation. \nIf you like this, be sure to subscribe to Recode Decode on , Spotify, ,  or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nKara Swisher: Recode Radio presents Recode Decode, coming to you from the Vox Media podcast network. \nHi, I\u2019m Kara Swisher, executive editor of Recode. You may know me as the only person who still says, \u201cMerry Grouponicus,\u201d but in my spare time, I talk tech, and you\u2019re listening to Recode Decode, a podcast about tech and media\u2019s key players, big ideas and how they\u2019re changing the world we live in. You can find more episodes of Recode Decode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Play Music, or wherever you listen to your podcasts, or just visit www.recode.net/podcasts for more.\nToday, I\u2019m in San Francisco with Casey Newton, the Silicon Valley editor of The Verge and host of the upcoming podcast Converge.\nHow are you doing?\nCN: Hello, Kara, I\u2019m doing great. How are you?\nKS: Good. You\u2019re here practicing for your upcoming podcast, Converge.\nCN: That\u2019s right. This is the second go-round. The first one was so successful, people demanded we make more audio content.\nKS: Nobody demanded it. You demanded it.\nCN: Well, I demanded and they did not oppose it.\nKS: Yes, they did not oppose it. It got well received on Twitter.\nCN: Yeah, it was good.\nKS: It was well received, it was quite good. Now we\u2019re here today and Casey\u2019s joining me for several episodes of Recode Decode and today we\u2019re thrilled to have one of my favorite entrepreneurs, Andrew Mason, in the red chair. He\u2019s best known as the founder and former CEO of Groupon, and in 2013 he co-founded the mobile audio company Detour. He just announced another new company we\u2019re going to talk about, and he\u2019s declining to put on headphones. I don\u2019t know why. Are they too ...\nAndrew Mason: I feel like I\u2019m going to do it at some point, but I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll throw me off my game.\nKS: No, it\u2019s ...\nWhat game is that having not spoken, it\u2019s not clear.\nKS: No, I like it. It\u2019s more intimate. Put them on right now. It creates a feeling of intimacy between us.\nI think what is does right now is it creates a power dynamic.\nCN: Oh, interesting.\nKS: Just put on the headphones. Put them on right now. Thank you. Isn\u2019t that better? Don\u2019t you feel better? Don\u2019t you feel closer affiliated with me and Casey here?\nWell ...\nKS: We\u2019ll wait and see.\nYes.\nKS: Andrew, when last I saw you, you were doing Detour. First let\u2019s talk about your history because I want to get into your new company. We have a whole hour to talk. Give the people who don\u2019t know you\u2019re famous ... oh, he took off the headphones.\nI can\u2019t do it. This is better.\nKS: All right, fine. Whatever you ... all right. As usual. Andrew and I have a long history of struggling with each other over a variety of issues.\nCN: That\u2019s what I like about both of you. Neither one of you likes to play by the rules.\nKS: No, none of us do.\nCN: And now it\u2019s really playing out.\nKS: No, not since he showed me his ...\nI\u2019m sorry, are you going to throw down on the headphones?\nKS: I might, I might.\nBecause this ... is this the place to make your stand?\nKS: Could be, who knows. Let\u2019s discuss your history.\nYeah, let\u2019s.\nKS: Our long history together. I first met you when you were a young entrepreneur at Excel. I think it was Excel I met you at, at the time you were there, you came in. You stuck your head ...\nI came to a ...\nKS: You were there. You were just there.\nWe raised money from Excel, so it might have had something to do with that.\nKS: Yes. You were there and they said you have to meet this guy and you were ...\nYes. Boy, were they right.\nKS: They were ... you were extremely obnoxious, I remember. I liked it. I thought it was kind of funny. You were talking about museums and how you started Groupon, and you were unusual for an entrepreneur, comparatively. You weren\u2019t from Silicon Valley.\nWhat do you mean museums?\nKS: You were talking about people you were interested in helping, museums and other things.\nWe had just done a deal for the Art Institute of Chicago and sold 5,000 memberships.\nKS: Right.\nCN: Wow.\nSomething like 10 percent of what they sell in a year. Many of those people went on to renew. Check it out: www.groupon.com. Daily deals on the best stuff to do in your city.\nKS: Okay. Talk about your short journey. People know what happened to Groupon and we\u2019ll talk about where it is right now. You don\u2019t have any involvement in that, do you?\nNo.\nKS: Not at all.\nCN: It started in secrecy ...\nI keep waiting for them to call so I can make my grandiose return.\nKS: You and Travis Kalanick are just waiting by the phone.\nI\u2019m just waiting but keeping myself busy, you know. I have hobbies ...\nKS: Yeah.\nCN: Is it true that the whole thing started because you couldn\u2019t get out of a cellphone contract, and that led you to your first thing, which then led you to Groupon?\nYes. It started out as this thing called The Point, and at the time I was ... before that I was getting my Masters Degree in the University of Chicago in public policy. I was learning about collective action problems and had this issue with my cellphone contract. These egregious contracts that they lock you into.\nKS: Sure.\nIt seemed like, man, if I could get a critical mass of people, a tipping point of people together and we all threatened to cancel our contract, then maybe they would take us seriously. Then the point became just a broader, or more abstracted, platform for that kind of concept. You get a bunch of people together, and they all agree to do something if some conditions are met. That thing could be doing something, it could be giving money toward something. One of the ways people were using it was to buy things as a group, group purchases. Then we just focused in on that and it became Groupon.\nCN: So what started as a radical left-wing idea quickly became a capitalist tool.\nThat\u2019s right. \nCN: That\u2019s fantastic.\nI mean, I always had a lifelong love of coupons since I was a small child.\nCN: Would you wake up early on Saturdays to cut them out of the circulars in the newspapers?\nYeah, and I would stitch them together into clothing.\nKS: I bet you did in that case. So you started Groupon, and I remember you announced the public offering at our conference onstage.\nNo, I didn\u2019t announce it. I totally played you, if I remember correctly.\nKS: Okay, all right. Explain that to me.\nYou were trying to get that information out of me.\nKS: Yes, we were.\nI won\u2019t fault you because you tried your best ...\nKS: I know.\nYou\u2019re not used to dealing with people as adept in rhetoric as I am, so you didn\u2019t know up from down.\nKS: I didn\u2019t know up from down, but you released it right afterwards. That\u2019s right, you released ...\nOh yeah, that\u2019s right.\nKS: The public offering. Tell me about that experience, because it didn\u2019t go well, I would say.\nWhat do you mean?\nKS: They fired you, as you recall, as you wrote about.\nWell, I mean, that\u2019s one way to look at it.\nKS: Okay.\nI would rather ...\nKS: How would you ...\nCN: Before it maybe went south, it went incredibly well.\nKS: Yes, I know. I want to know that experience. How did you look at that experience?\nHow did I look at what part of the experience?\nKS: What was the whole ...\nCN: It was the fastest-growing company of all time up until that point. That had to have been a pretty crazy ride for you coming out of a Master\u2019s project that turns into the fastest-growing company of all time.\nKS: You had that great office and on the walls of that office you had all the failures, I remember, in the lobby.\nYeah.\nKS: That what happened including the ones ...\nThe whole thing from the ride up and down was surreal and absurd. The absurdity ... there was something absurd about the heroification that happened on the way up.\nKS: Right.\nThen also the opposite of that on the way down. Luckily the ride up prepared me for all of that and I just look back on it as this crazy experience that I feel really lucky to have been part of.\nKS: Talk about what you were trying to do there. What do you think you did well?\nWith starting Groupon?\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nWhat do you mean?\nKS: I mean, what do you think you did well?\nIt\u2019s still a multi-billion dollar business.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nPeople still use it all the time and get a ton of value out of that, so we got that out there. What did I ... what else did I do well.\nKS: As CEO.\nCN: The name was really good. Where did the name come from? There\u2019s very few companies where the entire idea is in the name, and the name is less than 10 letters.\nYeah.\nCN: Did that come out of a hat, or an intern, or who gave you that one?\nThe guy that actually was in charge of all of the content came up with that name. His name is Aaron With and when we were like, we need to come up with a name for this group coupon company and he was like, how about Groupon? I make it sound less genius than it was, but that\u2019s where it came from.\nCN: It points to a great point, which is you should always hire content people for your company.\nKS: Absolutely.\nCN: Some might say we\u2019re the most important people you can have in a company.\nKS: I don\u2019t think so. I think we\u2019re not at all important.\nCN: I don\u2019t know.\nKS: Where I\u2019m trying to get at is, what did you expect to happen there in terms of your CEO experience. You were always a reluctant CEO. A lot of stuff you did at your headquarters pointed to, this could all go to hell, I might not be the right CEO, you did a bunch of ... remember when you were going to interview the little girl? Have the little girl interview you, the kindergartner?\nThat never happened.\nKS: I know, but you thought about ...\nYou told me that was a bad idea.\nKS: You thought of the idea. He was going to have a third-grader, right? A second-grader?\nI don\u2019t remember why.\nKS: They were going to discuss how you don\u2019t disclose things. The SEC rules. She was going to interview you on how bad you were at SEC rules.\nCN: That\u2019s amazing.\nKS: Yeah, he wanted to do that and I said he shouldn\u2019t, although I should have let him and then written about it.\nLet me tell you what I wasn\u2019t prepared for.\nKS: Right, okay.\nWhat I wasn\u2019t prepared for is I had a hard time taking myself seriously.\nKS: Right.\nThere\u2019s something true about tech. Here\u2019s the secret. I like people to believe that I\u2019m this super genius who\u2019s like, no I\u2019m sorry. Nothing had anything to do luck. This is all skill and capability and razor-sharp instincts. The fact of the matter is, there\u2019s an incredible amount of luck. There\u2019s a lot of people, entrepreneurs, out there who are way smarter and more capable than I am that have never had the kind of success of Groupon.\nKS: Mm-hmm. \nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m incompetent, but I do think that luck had a lot to do with it. I was just never comfortable with the amount of adulation on the way up, and I responded to that aggressively by going out of my way to seem stupid.\nKS: Right, right.\nCN: Were you at all insulated from that being in Chicago, or did the fact that it was this unique tech story in Chicago make it all the more intense because they had never seen a tech titan emerge there?\nI think in Chicago, there was ... I was just in Finland and Finland had all of their hopes and dreams tied to Nokia and now the country\u2019s in an identity crisis because of its collapse. I think, at least in tech, for a period of time, Groupon was carrying that weight for the city.\nKS: Yeah, you had a great headquarters by that section of the city that was ...\nYeah, and so I think it was then disappointing for people in Chicago when it didn\u2019t prove to earn its place alongside Facebook and Amazon and Microsoft and blah blah blah.\nKS: Right, right. One of the stories I remember writing about, before you went public, was selling to ... you just handled everything different than everyone else. It was a delight for a reporter, I\u2019ll tell you that, because you just said what I asked you. You usually answered the questions.\nThat was the problem.\nKS: Yeah, yeah.\nThat always worked for me when we were a private company. \nAnd getting back to what I wasn\u2019t prepared for, what I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the degree to which you entered the Big Leagues. It\u2019s an entirely different game once you\u2019re a public company. I just had this incredibly na\u00efve attitude, like, oh I\u2019ll just be myself and I\u2019ll just keep doing what I\u2019ve been doing and it\u2019ll be fine.\nKS: Right, which made me successful ...\nThe world and the markets were like, no. This is mincemeat.\nKS: So you couldn\u2019t bring a goat ... did you bring goat to the office, or a horse, or a Shetland pony?\nA horse.\nKS: A horse, that\u2019s right. Who was that for?\nIt was different than the Shervin horse. I just want to, I just feel ... I think that was not a cool horse to just, oh look at me. I\u2019m at a party. I\u2019m a horse. The reason ...\nCN: The idea that venture capitalists would bring horses to parties to avoid future accusations of sexual harassment was still many years away.\nKS: Many years. Why did you bring the horse to the party?\nThe horse: The story is that ... do you want the whole story?\nKS: Just the short version.\nThe whole story is good.\nKS: All right, go ahead. Go for it.\nThe whole story is that Michael Bloomberg was coming to visit our office.\nKS: Yes. Everyone came to visit you.\nWe thought, let\u2019s give him a gift and something to say thank you for coming. We were like, it would be funny to give him something that would be this incredible responsibility, because how to you react to something like that? At first, we thought we\u2019d give him a dog. But then it just seemed like he might believe that and it would be weird, so we pushed a little bit further and made it a horse. So we got the horse and then it came to the office and we do \u2014 By the way, I\u2019m mostly here to sell my product.\nKS: I know. We\u2019re going to talk about that.\nCN: There\u2019s plenty of time for that.\nKS: Yeah, plenty of time.\nHe sent his security guards up to look around, and that was new to me, I never had that, where security guards are going to come and do a sweep. I was like ...\nKS: You had a lot of dangerous items at that office.\nExactly. I was like, it would be funny if we just dressed up one of our customer service representatives as a terrorist.\nKS: No, don\u2019t do ... that\u2019s not funny.\nWe gave him a ski mask and put some fake grenades next to his ...\nKS: Oh, God.\nNext to his desk and we gave him a machine gun that he was wearing on his neck and then he just had the customer service headset on, and he was sitting typing at his computer. The way I thought of it is these poor security guards never find anything. This at least will be good for a laugh for them. They\u2019ll give me a high five. Anyway, my COO at the time saw that moments before the security guards came up and shut it down.\nCN: Probably for the best.\n\u201cThis is why you hired me: to stop you from doing these things.\u201d I regret that.\nKS: Which part?\nShutting it down.\nKS: Oh, all right, okay.\nI should have gone through with it.\nKS: So the horse, then, is backup.\nHe came ... that was unrelated, but that\u2019s part of the long version of the story. So then Bloomberg is coming up the stairs and we\u2019ve got the horse ready to present to him and then our PR person found out that his daughter had just been injured in a horse riding accident.\nCN: This is an episode of \u201cVeep.\u201d\nThere was this last-minute scramble to hide the horse. We ended up hiding the horse in the kitchen elevator.\nKS: Not that weird office that you had? The fake office of the person ...\nOh, Michael\u2019s room?\nKS: Michael\u2019s room, yeah.\nNo, not there because that\u2019s part of the tour.\nKS: That\u2019s part of the tour, that\u2019s right.\nCN: So you have a backup present to give Bloomberg?\nNo present for Bloomberg.\nKS: No present.\nCN: Wow.\nWe haven\u2019t been in touch since and that might be why.\nCN: He\u2019s never forgotten it.\nKS: Yeah, oh my God.\nNo present.\nKS: Oh my God, oh my God.\nVindictive guy.\nKS: In any case, you had a number of stunts and things that you did at the company. You had a very colorful CEO career. We\u2019re going to get to your next thing and then what you\u2019re doing now, but what did you ... you\u2019re one of the few people also who said, \u201cI was fired.\u201d You said that at a press release saying, \u201cI was fired.\u201d\nCN: I remember when that note came across all of our screens and it was crazy because it felt like the first time a tech CEO had been honest on their way out that anyone can remember.\nKS: We were going to say you were fired anyway, but why did you do that?\nI\u2019ll tell you why I did it and I\u2019ll tell you why it\u2019s probably a mistake to do that for people that are considering such a thing.\nKS: Personal reasons.\nI did it for that reason. It was so obvious to everybody that I would have been fired, right? \nKS: Right.\nEven if there was a family emergency or whatever, nobody would believe it.\nKS: No, no.\nSo, the only thing that I\u2019m doing in my mind at the time by pretending like I wasn\u2019t fired is deluding myself. Here\u2019s the reason it makes sense. Now, every time anybody writes about me, or at least when Detour came out, it was always like, \u201cousted Groupon CEO starts a new company.\u201d\nKS: Right.\nIt basically gives reporters permission to bring that up over and over again. We keep talking about it. Also, it\u2019s weird because I meet people at parties. I go to a lot of parties. I meet ... I don\u2019t really go to a lot of parties. When I meet people, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh yeah, I loved your ...\u201d Like that\u2019s what they remember me for is the letter.\nKS: Ousted is a good word.\nAnyway, so if you don\u2019t do that, I remember reading about Joshua Topolsky\u2019s resignation letter and he had been fired and, wait, he used to work here. It was from here that he was fired. Maybe I should find another example.\nKS: No, go right ahead. \nAnyway, he was so clearly fired and the letter was all, no awareness of that whatsoever, and it\u2019s worked for him.\nKS: It\u2019s worked, yeah.\nIt works for people all the time.\nKS: Yeah, yeah.\nI feel good about it. I would do it differently, but I also wouldn\u2019t recommend ... it\u2019s probably not worth it.\nKS: You also seemed somewhat relieved as I recall at the time, when you were just, you told the truth and then you moved on. No?\nRelieved in what sense?\nKS: I remember you talking as if you were relieved, maybe, or you were just lying.\nRelieved to not be at the company anymore?\nKS: Yes, yeah.\nCN: Or, to not have the pressures that came with being the CEO and having to be this person who maybe you didn\u2019t like to be.\nYeah, oh no, God. Running a public company, not for me.\nKS: Yeah, yeah.\nI wouldn\u2019t have chosen to be fired. If I could go back to that moment now and have not been fired, I would\u2019ve not been fired. Even though I\u2019m really glad to not be working at Groupon anymore, I still feel a responsibility to the to the company and to do what I can.\nKS: Yeah. So, afterwards you moved to San Francisco, right?\nYeah.\nKS: Relatively soon.\nYeah, yeah.\nKS: Yeah, and started Detour.\nAnd started Detour.\nKS: Talk a little bit about that and where it is right now.\nThere were about six months in between leaving Groupon and starting Detour. I moved out here, I had a kid.\nKS: You had a kid.\nI recorded an album of motivational business music. Then, Detour was actually an idea that I had before Groupon. What it is is it\u2019s an app for taking audio tours of cities. It\u2019s something I always did when I traveled. I always wanted a really exceptional way to explore cities with people that know them best and on your own terms.\nKS: It was quirky and interesting. Not your typical stops along the way, too. It was neighborly things.\nIt was good. It is good. People who have done it really love it. The challenge is when you pitch someone like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s go take an audio tour this weekend.\u201d The pre-existing ideas people have about that like, \u201cOh, an audio tour.\u201d\nKS: Yeah.\n\u201cYou mean like that kind of lame thing I do when I\u2019m in a museum and it happens to be there and I\u2019ll give it a try?\u201d \nIt\u2019s just been hard to build a mobile app that has such a high on-boarding requirement where you have to go out into the city and block off two hours before you can even have any idea of what the experience is like. I think it\u2019s really hard as a stand-alone travel startup. It\u2019s not going anywhere. I\u2019m not working there anymore and we don\u2019t have anything to announce about what\u2019s happening to it right now other than it\u2019s not going anywhere. Hopefully I\u2019ll have something happy to say about it in the next couple of months.\nKS: Mm-hmm. Is it sold, has it been sold?\nI can\u2019t say anything about what\u2019s happening to it.\nKS: I understand it\u2019s been sold, but okay.\nDo you really want to do your hard-hitting thing on this poor little startup?\nKS: No, not on your poor little startup. No. I liked it a lot, that\u2019s why.\nSave it for Yahoo.\nKS: I think it\u2019s a high ... yeah, they\u2019re done. We\u2019re done with them.\nYou finished them off.\nKS: We finished them off. \nCN: The question that I have for you, though ...\nKS: No, but I liked it. I\u2019m serious. I thought it was a great product.\nThank you.\nKS: I realize the difficulty of execution there.\nYeah.\nCN: I did too, and my parents actually would come up and visit me and request that we would do another one. It wound up being a really fun thing that I did with my parents a bunch. What I found so interesting from it was that when we first met, because I actually didn\u2019t meet you during the Groupon days. We met when you started Detour, and I couldn\u2019t imagine a company less like the one that you had previously been at, right? Some founders scratch the same itch over and over again, and you just went somewhere completely different. Why?\nWell, it was hard. Like I said, I did have this lifelong love for coupons.\nKS: Mm-hmm. But that was scratched.\nI do tend to get back ... I have some coupon 2.0 concept ...\nCN: Ooh. Two-pon might be an interesting ...\nThat\u2019s percolating.\nKS: Two-pon? Did you just say two-pon?\nCN: Yeah. A good company name.\nThat was more of a diversion than anything else. As reporters were ever so fond of pointing out during the tough times, I was a music major. I worked at a recording studio for a couple of years out of school, so getting into audio and content was something I was always interested in. Also, I just, I\u2019m looking to do things that I think are interesting and products that I want to exist and they don\u2019t all fit into one category. I\u2019m not driven by starting another $20 billion company.\nKS: Right.\nCN: Right.\nKS: All right, we\u2019re here with Andrew Mason. By the way, we like to point that out because it\u2019s interesting and it makes you different from all the other horrible geeks, just so you know.\nDoes it really?\nKS: Yes, it\u2019s a compliment. In any case, we\u2019re here with Andrew Mason. He\u2019s in the red chair. He\u2019s the founder and former CEO of Groupon, and he founded a mobile audio company called Detour, and he\u2019s just going to talk when we get back on a new company he just started.\n[ad]\nKS: We\u2019re here with Andrew Mason, the entrepreneur who started Groupon. He also did a company called Detour, which is a mobile audio company that did tours in cities, which was a terrific little company. Now, he has a new company we\u2019re going to talk about. Andrew, would you like to discuss your new company and what it\u2019s called?\nI would. For those of you who are just joining us, congratulations. The first part of this was basically worthless.\nKS: It\u2019s not, actually. You\u2019ll see.\nNow we\u2019re getting to the good stuff.\nKS: All right, good stuff. Leave behind the old, bring in the new.\nMy new company, much like ... one could think of it as a pivot, much like Groupon was a pivot.\nKS: All right.\nIt\u2019s been incubated inside of Detour for the last couple of years. At Detour, we\u2019re basically making these things, podcasts, that are scripted. We recorded hundreds of hours of voiceover sessions and our ultimate vision was to make Detour a platform where anyone would be able to produce these things. As we were using these tools that existed to create audio content, like talk-driven audio content, it became clear that it was just never going to happen with the tools that existed.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nThe learning curve is super high and then even once you understand it, it\u2019s tedious and slow because you\u2019re looking at these wave forms, just timelines and of wave forms, and even if you understand that stuff, you have to turn off your editorial brain and engage your engineering brain and it\u2019s really difficult to work with. We were aware of the explosion in progress that was happening around speech-to-text automated transcription, where now you have models that are transcribing audio and comprehending audio at rates higher than humans can.\nSo we thought, what if we could use that to create an audio editor that looked like a word processor and acted like a word processor, where instead of editing these wave form timelines, you could just edit text.\nKS: And it would change the audio.\nAnd it would change the audio. Exactly. So we built that inside of Detour as a way to make Detours, and then we would bring people into the office who were working in audio, or even in video, and they would just lose their minds. Half of them would be like, \u201cYeah we\u2019ve wanted this to exist for 20 years. Why has it taken this long to build it?\u201d People would just see the shortest little demo of it and get it right away. It was one of those things. This was happening as long as a couple years ago where it became clear that might be the actual thing.\nKS: So, a little bit like Odeo, which became Twitter, or Slack was out of the gaming company. I can\u2019t remember the name of the gaming company that Stewart started.\nCN: I can\u2019t remember. It was tiny something. Tiny something.\nKS: Yeah, similar. So, you were trying to create ...\nAny example that you can come up with of something that was really cool, but maybe not really popular, and then out of it something awesome and super popular that made a ton of money.\nKS: Right, a ton of money, right. But talk about the technology. Why has it taken 20 years? \u201cI wanted this for 20 years.\u201d People do meet engineering challenges for lots of people and lots of products. What was the problem?\nWe\u2019re leveraging the progress that big companies have made by using machine learning and artificial intelligence in speech-to-text recognition, where you now have a 95 percent accuracy with a decent sounding audio. Now all that stuff is becoming commoditized, where there is a zillion different APIs that you can use to get that stuff really fast and really cheap. That\u2019s really foundational. \nThe other thing that we do is this technology called text-audio alignment, where we can analyze the phonetic content of the audio and compare it to the text, and then basically layer the text on top of the audio, know the starting and ending point of every word, and that\u2019s stuff that we\u2019ve built. \nThe way we realized it was viable was a guy that was getting his PhD in this stuff at Berkeley, and we got him to come work for us. All this stuff is just starting to happen. In the last year, there have been a slew of different companies that are doing automated transcription, disrupting the human-powered transcription market, which ends up being a $10 billion market. Then we\u2019re taking that to the next step, which is not just ...\nKS: So it\u2019s editing.\nYeah, but actually editing and producing content.\nKS: Right.\nWe spun it out of Detour and we raised $5 million from Andreessen Horowitz, and the vision of this is to make audio and eventually video as easy to edit as it is with print. You know, print has this killer feature where you can write something and then you can rewrite it. You can edit.\nKS: Right, word processing.\nYeah, and audio doesn\u2019t work that way. And we\u2019re seeing this explosion of audio in popularity as a medium as evidenced by the fact that you guys are basically sitting in here all day recording podcasts.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nWe really need the tools to keep up with the consumer demand.\nKS: What had been the most advanced tools then? Because I\u2019ve used various [methods], but the idea of placing audio over text, essentially, or text over audio, really. You haven\u2019t been able to edit it, you have to have editors.\nThat\u2019s right.\nKS: Experienced editors. And so this is to remove them from the equation.\nThis allows you as ... We need a lot of people who come from a print journalism background and are getting into podcasts and they are beholden to some audio engineer. So they might do a piece and then they might do a paper edit of it, send it off to the audio engineer who does the edit, and then you get it back and you find out that the audio doesn\u2019t sound right when you cut it that way. We basically pair the two into one thing that the editor or the producer or the journalist can use as long as they know how to use a word processor.\nKS: What is it called, this company?\nDescript.\nKS: Descript. So, why is it called that?\nIt\u2019s derivative. It\u2019s not as good of a story as Groupon or something like that. It\u2019s basically, we had Detour and Descript. They both start with D.\nKS: Okay. All right.\nCN: And the company is headquartered in an underground crypt.\nYeah, it\u2019s Descript with a Y.\nCN: Who\u2019s your main customer? Is it podcast producers, or does it go beyond that?\nKS: You\u2019re saying video, you brought up video.\nFor now, we\u2019re starting with people that need transcriptions. It\u2019s a great stand-alone transcription service. You can drop an audio file in that\u2019s two hours long and get a transcript in a couple of minutes. Anyone that needs transcription, and then people who are working with audio as their primary medium: podcasters, radio. As we grow and as we add more stuff, the goal is yes, to become the new standard for how talk-driven media gets made.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nSo if you\u2019re working in talk-driven media, it just makes sense that you would be doing it from a script-driven viewpoint as opposed to a timeline-driven standpoint, where you\u2019re looking at these abstractions. For the same reason that people aren\u2019t programming in binary anymore, they\u2019re writing words, people would be editing using language and scripts if the technology existed, and now it\u2019s just starting to exist. Whether it\u2019s us that does it or somebody else, I think this is where it\u2019s headed.\nKS: Do their competitors in the area ... There\u2019s all kinds of different tools of transcription, as you said.\nOh yeah, there\u2019s quite a few transcription ...\nKS: Right, immediate transcription. I\u2019ve used a bunch of them.\nImmediate transcription services. And the dirty secret of them is they\u2019re all using one of the same series of APIs that\u2019s provided ... I mean, for the most part, they\u2019re all using the same series of APIs like Google and Nuance and IBM and now Amazon. We use the Google speech API, but we\u2019re relatively agnostic and we\u2019re focused on creating the instrumentation to measure these different APIs and their accuracy for different types of audio and pick the right one for the right type of audio. Then build tools beyond that, because it doesn\u2019t stop at the transcript, right? You do stuff with it.\nKS: Right. Well, that\u2019s the point. Sometimes they\u2019re separate. You do the transcript as separate from the creation completely.\nCN: I\u2019ve sort of always assumed that the basic transcription stuff will eventually become free. Do you think that\u2019s the case?\nI do, yeah. It feels like storage where it\u2019s just getting cheaper and faster and more accurate and commoditized.\nCN: So you can sell it today, but eventually your business is going to be something else.\nYeah, and we sell it pretty cheap. I mean, seven cents a minute. And then we have a subscription fee and that\u2019s where ...\nKS: So, your thing is the technology of being able to edit. The editing technology, essentially.\nYeah, editing, and for people that are doing it today but hopefully very much if you think about how the number of people that had darkrooms before Photoshop came along. Hopefully we can create that same ...\nKS: I had a darkroom.\nYou did?\nKS: Yeah.\nYeah, okay. So my point is completely invalid then, is that what you\u2019re saying?\nKS: No, no. I just liked it. I just was thinking of it yesterday, for some reason.\nOkay. You just were mentioning that you had a darkroom.\nKS: I did. I just said if people had darkrooms ...\nMaybe you could have saved that until I finish my point.\nKS: All right, finish your point.\nIt\u2019s a good ...\nKS: Finish your point, finish your point.\nCN: Some people say that any room Kara Swisher is in is a darkroom, but that\u2019s another story.\nKS: Finish your point. I was going to be nice to you, but go ahead.\nWhat was my point?\nKS: People had darkrooms and now ...\nOh yeah.\nCN: And now Photoshop.\nAnd now they have Photoshop, and there\u2019s a lot more people that have Photoshop than had darkrooms.\nKS: Right.\nWe hope it\u2019s the same kind of thing with audio and video, where it\u2019s prohibitively difficult to manipulate that content, and by taking away those prohibitions but reducing the friction and making content creation as expressive as print or text, you can enable a whole new class of creators.\nKS: Why has this not been done in the past?\nThe technology hasn\u2019t existed. \nKS: Right.\nOr it hasn\u2019t been mature enough to be able to ...\nKS: You mean the transcription technology.\nYeah, and the text-audio alignment and all this stuff is being enabled by machine learning and artificial intelligence and blah blah blah.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nCN: Is the technology such that I could take, say, a long speech that Kara gave and just sort of pick and choose the words, and then rearrange them and then create new audio of her just saying whatever I wanted her to say?\nAbsolutely. Now, we\u2019re not going to re-sample at the boundaries of the edits in a way that it\u2019ll sound natural so you\u2019ll have to ... There will be a little bit of skill involved in that. But that\u2019s where we want to take it. We can talk about the ethical implications of that.\nCN: Yeah.\nBut that\u2019s definitely where we want to take it, where you can move things around and as thoughtlessly as you would move around text and still have it work and you don\u2019t have to get in and do a cross-fade and adjust your edit boundaries. Really, what we\u2019re doing with Descript, by pairing the text and audio as one thing, we\u2019re setting ourselves up for this future of artificial-intelligence-assisted media synthesis. That\u2019s one example of it, because all of a sudden, your media, your audio or your video, you have meaning behind it because of the natural language processing you can do on the text.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nIt\u2019s really cool to think about what you could do. Like in this case, we know if you put a period at the end of a sentence, or a question mark, there\u2019s things that we can do to make that sound natural.\nKS: Mm-hmm. So your clients would be initially journalists, or people who are creating audio products.\nRight. \nKS: Then this is something you\u2019ve been interested in a long time. You and I had a very interesting discussion in Germany once about you wanting to do group source ... I think it was group sourcing journalism or protection ... is it out of that interest in journalism? You actually like journalists, I think, secretly.\nWhy do you think I don\u2019t like journalists?\nKS: I just, I ... because sometimes you\u2019re quite hostile, but go ahead.\nI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re referring to.\nKS: You\u2019re funny hostile, but hostile nonetheless.\nWhen I was ... I was actually working on another startup idea when I was in school for public policy. I still want to go back and do it. It was called Policy Tree, and the idea was you would take the bait and break it down into the atomic assertions and show them on a flow chart where you would have some like ... at the time, it was like, we should invade Iraq. Then, stemming from that, in green and red bubbles or leafs, would be the arguments for and against and then more arguments would stem from that, and so on. It wasn\u2019t like this public forum for debate. The idea was that it was aggregating all of the things that people were saying in the popular media outlets. Breaking it down in a way that ...\nKS: So you can see the arguments.\nTo make sense of it all.\nKS: Right, right.\nIt\u2019s been a fascination of mine for a long time and I think audio as a medium is a ... I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m about to say, because I\u2019m talking to Casey, but it has an empathy bias, or an empathy handicap where there\u2019s something about not needing to stare at someone\u2019s ugly face that makes it easier to relate to them.\nKS: Yeah. I would agree with you. I think it has a different ... I mean, when they\u2019re on television, it creates a circus-like effect, and audio is much more intimate.\nYeah. The reason I said I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say that is I feel like every startup founder finds a way to talk about how their company is making the world more empathetic. It must be even though the fact that I\u2019m aware of it, I can\u2019t stop myself.\nKS: Talk more about this journalism, because this would be an aid to creating businesses, media businesses, or helping people do media businesses cheaper, or bring down the costs for doing them, because a lot of these things are not prohibitively expensive necessarily, but they\u2019re prohibitively creative, I guess. You can\u2019t be as creative as you want if you\u2019re not in charge.\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. I feel like a lot of the ...\nKS: Word processing has changed everything for journalism.\nRight, totally. The beauty of the word processor is it\u2019s kind of like they built it. You know, even the typewriters, the basic concept, they built it and if that\u2019s your medium, you learn the tool and you\u2019re done. Everything else in your career is about evolving your craft.\nKS: Right.\nBeing more effective at getting the ideas in your head down onto paper, and it doesn\u2019t work that way with audio or video. You have to constantly be invested in learning the latest tools. Our goal is to make it as intuitive as a word processor, but also a lot of the creative tools that have come along for people are about, oh you press a button and all of a sudden we\u2019ll cut your video in a way that\u2019s magical, and we\u2019ll put background music, and we\u2019ll do all this stuff automatically, but I think there\u2019s still ...\nKS: Automagically.\nAutomagically, yeah, I love that. I love that. There\u2019s still a role for craft and intention, and that\u2019s the kind of media production that we\u2019re focused on, is people that have a specific idea of what they want to create and they just want tools that get things out of their way so they can express that vision more effectively.\nCN: Let\u2019s talk about video. One of the big trends this year was the pivot to video for all of us media types. We were once more heavily invested in other forms but then certain other platforms started demanding video media in a huge way. It\u2019s incredibly labor intensive, time intensive, it just costs a lot of money and time to make video. What can you do to make that faster for these companies? If not now, then eventually.\nI don\u2019t ...\nKS: You\u2019re starting with audio.\nYeah, we\u2019re starting with audio because audio is part of video.\nCN: I like to dream though, Andrew, I\u2019m a big dreamer.\nKS: I like audio.\nI don\u2019t know how far we can take that. I know that we had ... What got us thinking about video was at one point, one of Errol Morris\u2019s editors came through our office and he had just finished editing 30 hours of Donald Rumsfeld interviews for that movie, and he was just begging us to do a video version because of the amount of time it would have saved him instead of scrolling through a timeline, looking at a talking head. To be able to search by a script and do everything in that way. There\u2019s some really incredible implications of moving to this word processor format. \nThe way that ... we haven\u2019t released it yet, but in the next ... our near-term focus is doing a multi-track version where I can add music and multiple tracks of voice. And the way that works is if I want to add a music file to my piece, I just drag and drop it at the word where I want it to start playing, and it starts playing. So, that\u2019s an example of how well this idea of the word processor, or this UI paradigm ...\nKS: You can put pictures in and stuff like that, the way you do.\nYeah, totally, totally.\nKS: All right, we\u2019re here with Andrew Mason. We\u2019re talking about his new company, Descript, which is, what are you calling it, what\u2019s your little two-second word description. Audio software company?\nYeah, we call it an audio word processor.\nKS: Audio word processor. When we get back, we\u2019re going to talk more about it and also, where he thinks things are going in the tech space. I know you have some opinions, Andrew.\nI\u2019m not ...\nKS: All right then, fine. We won\u2019t talk about that. We\u2019ll talk about your baby and everything else. We\u2019re also here with Casey Newton on Recode Decode.\n[ad]\nKS: We\u2019re here on Recode Decode with the obstreperous Andrew Mason, who is difficult as usual despite the fact that I\u2019m trying to hawk his new company, Descript. We were just talking about it. We\u2019re here with Casey Newton from The Verge, who is my co-host over several episodes.\nCN: We\u2019re having a great time.\nKS: We\u2019re having a great time. I want to get back to this concept of where audio is going because it has boomed in terms of podcasts, and in terms of where you were into it doing Detour, your last company. You talked about the intimacy of it. It really is. It\u2019s been something that\u2019s worked very well with mobile. Where do you see that industry going overall, the audio industry, because I think it\u2019s a bigger one than people realize.\nYeah.\nKS: Just sort of a bold thought, I suppose.\nWhat gets me excited is just how much more time of the day seems to be coming accessible to audio-first experiences. Obviously mobile phones are enabling that, things like carplay are enabling that. I think we\u2019ll look back and see airpods and really great wireless headphones as another kind of step-function enabler of audio, where all of a sudden this relatively simple innovation of taking the wires away reduces the friction of having headphones with you and taking them out of your pocket and putting them in your ears, right?\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nI mean, if I\u2019m going now to take a walk and get a coffee, I can take my headphones out. I have them with me all the time, which wasn\u2019t always the case. Even when I did have them with me, you have to untangle them, it\u2019s stupid stuff, right? But it\u2019s often like solving the stupid little things that makes all the difference. I think all of that is just getting us to the point where audio has a lot of head room.\nKS: Right, because you could also have our heads up. We could look around at the same time you\u2019re listening.\nThere\u2019s just these incredible examples of content that don\u2019t exist anywhere else. \nKS: What do you like?\nI like Sam Harris\u2019s podcast. I\u2019ve learned more from that than anything I can remember in recent memory, because he has these three-hour-long incredibly nuanced conversations with people. Even the same kind of format as this, right, where people can just have a conversation and it\u2019s not about just pulling out one quote.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nI think stuff like that is really exciting. Stuff like The Daily. Do you guys listen to The Daily?\nCN: Yeah.\nKS: Mm-hmm. Yeah, we just had Michael Barbaro on.\nYeah, like oh my God. The Daily, for me, you listen to something like ... You think about how you read about gun violence in the press and you might go around and read 15 minutes of articles and you just feel like shit and the world is hell in a hand-basket and everybody\u2019s stupid. Then you listen to an episode of The Daily and they interview somebody that you just couldn\u2019t agree less with, but yet you walk away with an appreciation for their sincerity and the fact that they\u2019re not evil, crazy or stupid. They\u2019re doing what they think the right thing is. I think there\u2019s just something about that medium and their approach. It\u2019s weird listening to The Daily. You listen to an episode and you walk away feeling good.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nYou understand things a little bit better. That\u2019s not how you\u2019re used to feeling.\nKS: Well, does it have to do with the intimacy of being ... you\u2019re pummeled everyday with visuals, everything\u2019s visual. Either it\u2019s Twitter, reading visual, or imagery. It\u2019s exhausting and not understandable. \nRight.\nKS: I think audio creates an intimacy. I do find it interesting, the people that talk \u2014 and you\u2019ll find this, Casey \u2014 the people that talk to me who love the podcasts are a very different fan base.\nMm-hmm.\nKS: They almost love you. It\u2019s really, they feel ... I may be putting it in their ear. No, it\u2019s ...\nHow\u2019s that different?\nKS: Well, they don\u2019t love you. In the other, they don\u2019t. They\u2019re sort of like, \u201cThat annoyed me,\u201d or, \u201cYou pissed me off.\u201d Even if they don\u2019t agree, they\u2019re ... first of all, it\u2019s much more civil. I know it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s much ... the way you present yourself, I suppose. I\u2019m not like Rush Limbaugh going \u201cahh!\u201d like that all the time, but it has evolved into a much more thoughtful medium, I guess. Where people can actually think in long sentences.\nCN: I also think one of the only times I feel relaxed in this day and age is when I\u2019m having a conversation with someone, right? Where you\u2019re just able to get a different point of view. Where you are able to wander for a really long time. I often think the longer podcasts are often better, when in print a longer story is often, usually, not better.\nKS: Sometimes, yeah. You\u2019re right. And also, it\u2019s evolved from talk radio, which was very screamy. How does that work, for example, when you put talk radio on your thing? Because that\u2019s just a lot of screaming.\nI don\u2019t think those are super highly edited. I think they\u2019re broadcast live, it may not be the best use case for it, or maybe they\u2019ll find ways to edit in some more screams.\nKS: Yeah, or something like that. But it has evolved in that way. When you\u2019re talking about this business, you\u2019ve got $5 million. What are you charging for the software, what is the ... is it a subscription service?\nYeah. It\u2019ll be $20 a month right now. For early adopters, it\u2019s $10 a month. Then we charge per minute for transcription, 7 cents a minute. We also have a version that has no monthly fee for people that just want to use the transcription service. It\u2019s 15 cents a minute for that version. You can download it and get 30 free minutes of transcription and demo all the audio editing features. We also have a promo going where your transcript is guaranteed in fiv3 minutes or less or your pizza is free.\nKS: Oh, all right.\nYup.\nCN: When you\u2019re doing the transcriptions, are you relying on humans at all for this? Do humans ever touch the audio?\nNo. Humans don\u2019t touch the audio, it\u2019s all automated.\nCN: It\u2019s all algorithms.\nYeah.\nCN: All right.\nAlthough we do have a white-glove version too if you\u2019re not happy with the quality of ... because there\u2019s still, for certain types of audio ... for something like this, the transcription would be great. It\u2019s probably 98 percent accurate, but if you\u2019re recording on an iPhone in a ...\nKS: Noisy place.\nIn a cavernous conference room and four people are having a conversation, it\u2019s going to be lower, and we have human powered transcription for those people.\nKS: So they listen to it also. You do it, and then they ...\nYeah, that\u2019s how it works.\nKS: Yeah, I figured. When you think about this, you\u2019re going to have a subscription service, who are your customers then? Are you going to aim at media, you\u2019re aiming at who?\nPeople that need transcription services and people who are working with audio as their medium.\nKS: The market now, again, there\u2019s just transcription services that I can think of, and then there\u2019s audio editing software.\nRight, so between all of those professional creative tools, there\u2019s millions of people that are using those things already, so the hope is that some of them will also use Descript and that we can increase the size of the market by creating a tool that makes it easier and more accessible to use this stuff.\nCN: Are you interested in other parts of the podcast tech stack, like all the things you would need to create a podcast, whether it\u2019s the actual recording software or hosting or distribution. Does any of that interest you over time?\nShould we be? Is it a pain?\nCN: Yes, there are a shocking number of podcasters still using Garage Band, a tool that was made primarily for making ...\nThat I think we\u2019re very interested in, that part of it.\nCN: Yeah.\nWe\u2019ll be at a point within a relatively short period of time where you can produce a soup-to-nuts podcast in Descript.\nKS: Mm-hmm. In Descript, doing this. All the different things including music and whatever else you want to use.\nYeah.\nKS: How many people do you have running this?\nEight.\nKS: Eight. Small.\nSmall.\nKS: How are you going to run this differently? Will there be horses and things like that?\nHow am I going to run it differently than ...\nKS: Than Groupon.\nThan Groupon? Man, that\u2019s ... in a lot of ways, I guess. But ...\nKS: What have we learned, Andrew? What is your learning lessons?\nMost of the things that I\u2019ve learned are relatively banal. They\u2019re things that we could pick up in numerable business books, and they\u2019ll express it better than I would. It\u2019s about how to be a ... managing people is not an innate skill. It\u2019s like learning to golf or something. It just takes practice and learning from better people. I learned a lot over the course of my time at Groupon and I continue to learn. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t have anything super ...\nKS: I\u2019m trying to get to the wider venture space and how you look at Silicon Valley because, again, you\u2019ve had an unusual relationship with them, I would say. I mean that you were not highly impressed by the scene. You weren\u2019t a scene maker. You\u2019re not someone who shows up everywhere.\nCN: And you didn\u2019t ...\nI like being invited to things. I just don\u2019t like going.\nCN: You didn\u2019t raise capital for Detour, did you?\nI didn\u2019t.\nCN: Yeah.\nPart of that was because I always knew it was ... I take it very seriously, the idea of being a steward of other people\u2019s money, and I didn\u2019t want to take that on. It always felt experimental in a lot of ways.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nI thought it could be a really big business, don\u2019t get me wrong. But I wanted a little bit of meat on the bone before I asked somebody to take a bet on me on that. I also just wanted a little bit of a break from working with investors. For the most part, my experience was good. My experience with the investors out here was largely good, but I just wanted to see what it would be like to not have to think about that. I actually miss it now.\nCN: I was going to ask, what was different about this company that made you say, \u201cI\u2019m going to go play in the VC world again\u201d?\nTwo things. One is we\u2019ve had this product in beta for a while. We have people using it. We really feel pretty strongly that there\u2019s a there there. We feel better about product market fit. It doesn\u2019t feel as experimental. It\u2019s like a beautiful thing to be building just a tool that exists in the tool chain, instead of making a bet that, oh I\u2019m going to invent this new consumer behavior.\nKS: Mm-hmm.\nThe other thing is, I like having somebody on the team who\u2019s super smart and just relentlessly focused on the financial outcome to counterbalance the focus on how to come up with some ridiculous horse-involved scheme.\nKS: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to do that. But how do you look at the Silicon Valley ... Who\u2019s the venturist, is it Chris Dickson, or who is it?\nAlex Rampell.\nKS: Oh, interesting.\nYeah. Do you know him?\nKS: Yes, I do.\nHe\u2019s awesome.\nKS: Yeah. How do you look at this ... how are you thinking of this experience, though? That\u2019s what I want to know. How do you look at Silicon Valley now? You live here, you\u2019ve had a lovely child, you\u2019re still where you lived before in the city.\nYeah.\nKS: I think moving here, you were one of the people I wouldn\u2019t have ever thought would come to the San Francisco scene.\nOh, really?\nKS: Yeah. I don\u2019t know why. You\u2019re too good for it.\nWhy do you think that is?\nKS: You\u2019re not like other entrepreneurs. That\u2019s a compliment, trust me. They really irritate me, most of them. They just, you know, they\u2019re on the make, they\u2019re just always ...\nYou\u2019re going to be disappointed in my answer. I love it here.\nKS: Do you? Okay, tell me why. I\u2019m not disappointed. I want to know how you look at it. I don\u2019t care what you think.\nThe people out here are so smart and so engaging and you really feel ... like to complain about it out here, I feel like it\u2019s 450 BC and I\u2019m in the Roman forum and it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat the? That Socrates guy is such an asshole. He\u2019s just going on and on and bloviating.\u201d For better or worse, we\u2019re in a special place in a very special moment of time.\nKS: That is a fair point. Socrates still could have been an asshole, but go ahead.\nRight.\nKS: He probably was.\nIt just feels really exciting to be out here and the quality of life. The weather. Having lived in Chicago, you know, Casey, it\u2019s like you come out here and you\u2019re like, do those people know that this place exists? That you don\u2019t have to be freezing your ass off? It\u2019s really simple and trite to say that it\u2019s cold in Chicago, but it\u2019s fucking cold in Chicago.\nKS: It is.\nCN: Also, the thing I\u2019ve never gotten over about Chicago is the way that a sunny day is an event there on the order of a Federal holiday.\nKS: It is such a nice sunny day there.\nCN: Yeah.\nKS: They do have nice sunny days.\nThey do. There\u2019s wonderful things about it. The people are wonderful but ...\nKS: I love the architecture. I love Chicago.\nCN: That\u2019s great. Chicago just needs a big industry. That\u2019s its problem. Chicago just, you know ...\nKS: It\u2019s such a beautiful city. I think it\u2019s such a beautiful city. So, you like living here. You enjoyed moving here.\nYeah, it\u2019s been great.\nKS: Yeah. When you look out on the scene, and we\u2019re going to finish up talking about ... where do you see tech right now, and try to be a big thinker here. Try hard. Do you ...\nI hate doing big thinking.\nKS: Then don\u2019t. Think small then. How do you look ... Where are we?\nYou\u2019ll have to direct me a little bit more.\nKS: Where are we in the innovation cycle, if you think there is such a thing?\nI\u2019m so bored by this question.\nKS: All right. All right then.\nCN: Is there a small thing out there that ...\nKS: Let\u2019s then talk about \u201cThe Patriot\u201d and why you don\u2019t like it.\nDid you really watch \u201cThe Patriot\u201d?\nKS: I love \u201cThe Patriot.\u201d I hate Mel Gibson, but I love \u201cThe Patriot.\u201d It\u2019s really bad.\nI mean, I ...\nKS: Anytime it\u2019s on, I totally watch it.\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since I watched it, so I\u2019m going to watch it again.\nI\u2019ll give it a second chance.\nKS: Heath Ledger is in it.\nI respect your judgment.\nKS: It\u2019s so good.\nCN: All I remember is that there\u2019s a loose nuclear weapon.\nKS: What? No.\nCN: No wait, that\u2019s \u201cBroken Arrow.\u201d\nKS: Yes.\nCN: What\u2019s \u201cThe Patriot\u201d about?\nYou said that earlier and I was like, okay, nuclear weapon. It\u2019s about the Revolutionary War.\nKS: The Revolutionary War.\nCN: Oh, that\u2019s a totally different movie.\nKS: Mel has a little thing in his hair. Whatever he wears ...\nCN: Wow.\nA ponytail.\nKS: Ponytail.\nCN: Such a different time.\nKS: He has a ponytail and he runs around with a gun and then there\u2019s this really bad British guy.\nI\u2019m going to watch it again and I\u2019m going to send you notes back.\nKS: A really bad British guy.\nCN: Is it just American \u201cBraveheart\u201d basically?\nKS: But better. \u201cBraveheart\u201d is ...\nIt\u2019s like, how do I keep this \u201cBraveheart\u201d thing going?\nKS: Yes. But it\u2019s much better. It\u2019s much better. It\u2019s so good and it\u2019s very sad in parts.\nCN: All right, it sounds like we\u2019re having a movie night.\nKS: It\u2019s really good. It\u2019s sad, too. It goes there on the sad, don\u2019t you think?\nI don\u2019t ... it was 20 years ago.\nKS: Oh my God.\nI didn\u2019t bring it up.\nKS: I literally just saw it the other night\nI wasn\u2019t prepared for somebody who was such a \u201cPatriot\u201d aficionado.\nKS: But why don\u2019t you like it? You were saying you didn\u2019t like \u201cHamilton,\u201d you didn\u2019t like ...\nOh, no. Why did you do that? \nKS: Because you won\u2019t answer my innovation question.\nWhy did you tell people I didn\u2019t like \u201cHamilton\u201d?\nKS: We have five more minutes and I want to know how you\u2019re doing.\nI think it\u2019s my problem that I didn\u2019t like \u201cHamilton,\u201d to be clear. I don\u2019t know, I just think ... \nKS: All right, what do you think of Trump?\nI don\u2019t know. What do you guys think?\nKS: Are you political? I don\u2019t like him.\nWhat is it about ...\nKS: Every single part.\nWell, that\u2019s interesting. I haven\u2019t heard that.\nKS: I think he\u2019s entertaining, but in a really awful way.\nYeah. I\u2019m on the edge, you know. I keep on ... I see both sides and I can\u2019t make up my mind. These people need to write some more articles about it.\nCN: Undecided voter, Andrew Mason.\nKS: Undecided voter, Andrew Mason. So, you\u2019re going to run this? You\u2019re going to hope it gets to be enormous and makes a ton of money? \nYeah.\nKS: What is your valuation now?\nIt\u2019s a little pre-launch product.\nKS: Pre-launch.\nTo utter that out loud would be a disservice to your listeners.\nKS: Can they get it? They can get it now.\nThey can get the app, yeah. Starting ... we launched on Tuesday the 12th and it is now after Tuesday the 12th.\nKS: And it\u2019s available on what platform?\nDescript.com. It\u2019s on Mac for now.\nKS: Okay.\nWe\u2019re working on web support.\nKS: Okay.\nWhere we are right now, the kind of audio editing, there\u2019s not really any good examples of web-based technology doing it.\nKS: Right, and then people can do these on the fly or not? You could have people in foreign countries doing a lot of your reports, right? \nFor sure, yeah. We only support English right now.\nKS: Right.\nSo that\u2019ll get in the way, but more language is coming.\nKS: What about a mobile version?\nIt\u2019s just Mac.\nKS: It\u2019s just Mac.\nYou can also ... oh, another cool thing you can do is you can publish your compositions that you create. Your audio-linked transcripts to the web and then other people can comment on them, like Google Docs style, so that\u2019s for anybody that\u2019s reviewing audio or doing it in a collaborative environment with other people. It\u2019s a really awesome way to get feedback.\nCN: So, as I\u2019m putting my podcasts together, I could let my editor sit, actually look at the transcript, and just be like, \u201cThis is where it went completely off the rails.\u201d\nRight, exactly.\nKS: So many places. All right, I have one more question. When you look at Groupon now, what do you think about this being run in Chicago?\nI don\u2019t look at it that closely. I thought you might ask me this, and I remember coming up with that answer. It took a lot of work, but also just realizing how untrue it would sound.\nKS: Yeah.\nBut it\u2019s actually true. I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. I do Google Groupon and I look for news, but there\u2019s no news. Everybody I know is gone.\nKS: Right, yeah. Some companies are like that.\nYeah.\nKS: But you\u2019re not like, my time as CEO. You\u2019re the opposite of Travis Kalanick. You don\u2019t want to get back in there, into the big game.\nNo.\nKS: No.\nNo. Yeah, I\u2019m good.\nKS: Okay. Do you have any more questions for our lovely Andrew Mason?\nCN: My final question was, you mentioned earlier that you had recorded this album of inspirational business music. I just wondered if you felt like you had a follow-up in you. I was wondering if there\u2019s an album of business protest music, where you could talk about how important it is to be able to keep your profits offshore, that kind of thing?\nKS: I enjoyed your business ...\nYeah, I mean, you know the impact has been humbling. It\u2019s just, I look around ...\nKS: That Grammy was amazing.\nJust the impact in the business world. Some things it\u2019s hard to measure by sales, or just the quantity. It\u2019s the quality. I read an article about a Twitter all-hands meeting, where they were talking about how, \u201cLook guys. We need to turn this around and you know who\u2019s going to do it? We are. Nobody else is going to get in our way. Nobody\u2019s going to help us get there.\u201d Of course, I have a track on my album called \u201cIt\u2019s Up To Us.\u201d\nKS: I remember.\nThat\u2019s where they took those ideas. That was really humbling. Just in general, seeing how the economy has been growing and just up and to the right, since the album came out. I don\u2019t want to do it again and be like David Bowie or Elton John, where it\u2019s just ... \nKS: The same thing.\nI\u2019m more like a Billy Joel. You just quit while you\u2019re ahead.\nKS: Andrew Mason, you\u2019re very funny. I do miss you, I have to say. Not that much.\nMiss you, too.\nKS: Not that much.\nYeah, let\u2019s do this again in three years.\nKS: For your next business. No, I like this idea, I have to tell you.\nYou liked the last idea too. A lot of good it did me.\nKS: I liked it. I did think it had limited capabilities because of the platform.\nYeah. No, that\u2019s legit.\nKS: You had to be ... it was quirky. It was quirky tours by Andrew, essentially, but it would have been cool if you could\u2019ve made a platform for people, and then anybody could have made. You know what I mean?\nWell, maybe you should run the company next time, Kara.\nKS: No. No thank you. I\u2019m doing just fine here with Casey Newton. We really enjoy it. I\u2019m an entrepreneur sometimes, every now and again. Anyway, it\u2019s been totally enjoyable having you. I forgot how much I really did enjoy talking to you and I think I was completely right about you not being interviewed by a 7-year-old when you were a public company CEO, and I\u2019m sticking with that.\nWell, I still got fired, so ...\nKS: You got fired later.\nI would have rather had done that.\nKS: Yes. Oh, you would have?\nYeah, sure.\nKS: You can do that to this day.\nOkay.\nKS: All right. Andrew Mason, it was great talking to you.\nThank you for having me, it was a lot of fun.\nKS: Thanks for coming on the show and you\u2019re fantastic and Casey, thank you for co-hosting.\nCN: No, it was my pleasure.\n\n\n", "id": 3, "title": "Full transcript: Former Groupon CEO Andrew Mason on Recode Decode"}	
{"content": "Today we are going to talk about the Albigensian Crusade or the crusade of the Church against the Cathars. The Cathars possessed valid spiritual and magical techniques and the \u201cperfected ones\u201d, the ones that really had traveled the path and done the work, performed many impressive miracles in front of the population.The sect grew rapidly. Smaller sects were formed which mangled and destroyed the Christian faith, all under the name of the Cathars or Albigensian\u2019s. They were all lumped together under the same name. Some believed one thing, some believed another and it was a real tangled mess.But here are a few examples of what they did with Orthodox Christian theology.If God knew that Adam and Eve would die from eating of the tree of knowledge, why did he let them eat it in the first place? And you know they didn\u2019t die from eating from the tree of knowledge, but they became mortal and died later on in life after living long lives. They died because they were mortal.Why were both good people and evil people allowed to perish at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah or in the great flood? These questions went on and on. The entire world couldn\u2019t have been filled with only only evil people.Christians said that God suffered death upon the cross, that he died upon the cross. How can a God suffer, and how can a god die? How can a God come down to earth at all, and how was the earth created from his own body?How can a God eat and drink like Jesus did. What\u2019s this thing about communion and eating the body of Christ. It should\u2019ve long been eaten up by now after all these centuries!Then there was the subject of sexuality and sin. Why is sex sinful? How can we sin, by procreating? We are meant to continue the human species!These were just a few of the questions the Cathars discussed.Rome was a den of murderers. This was the epic war written of in the book of revelations.Things became violent. They mocked and killed priests wherever they could find them and they used the holy implements for obscene purposes. A large part of their ritual became a mockery or parity of the Catholic mass and became what has been called the black mass which they performed upon entry into their cult.At induction every novice had to denounce all Catholic belief, spit upon the cross, renounce baptism and unction. After this he would be kissed by the entire congregation and hands would be laid in blessing upon his or her head.You can see just how reactive the Cathars were against Christianity but you have to remember that the Catholic Church at that time was mostly filled with rational atheists.The Church elders didn\u2019t really believe in the spiritual side of the Church at all. The Church was political. They believed in the temporal power of the Church itself, and tried to dominate the population. This movement of the people was a big threat to their authority.A crusade against the heretics was preached. St. Dominic, the creator of the holy Inquisition, was charged with conducting the campaign and he became one of the most gruesome executioners that world history has ever known.Simon de Montfort led the crusade against his own countrymen, most of whom were Cathars. It was a horrible massacre.During the conquest of B\u00e9riers 60,000 people were killed, whether they were Christian or Cathar.\u201cFor God knows who are his!\u201d cried the abbot of Citeaux.He also confessed to Pope Innocent that he was only able to kill 20,000. The surviving population fled to the forests and the mountains. Only Carcassonne remained as a fortification and no one dared defend it.Hundreds there were hanged, and 500 burned. The people tried running to the nobles for protection, but the nobles fell one by one as the kindness of the Savior shone in its full brilliance.At the fortress of Minerva it was promised that those who repented would be allowed to live. They were burned anyway!\u201cIf he lies, he will get what he deserves. If he converts to the true faith the fire will extinguish his sin.\u201dThat was the standard procedure which they used during the entire Inquisition. These Knights of the Holy Spirit, murdered, hanged, burned and broke on the wheel, not just individuals, but hundreds and thousands of people.The church needs to own this. It\u2019s part of their history. A few hundred were killed at Lavour with love and with extreme joy. 12,000 were murdered at Maurillac and Toulouse with unspeakable joy.The entire South of France was destroyed and not a single stone remained standing. All the fortresses were destroyed. The nobles were hanged or burned, and the noble ladies were stoned out of gallantry so they didn\u2019t have to suffer the indignity of being hanged or burned at the stake.The church thought it had won and on the outside it seemed that way. The land was decimated. There was no trace of the heresy or the deeply hidden beliefs. But that was only on the outside. Never before had such a hatred penetrated so deeply into the hearts of the general population as after the massacre at Toulouse. Scarcely had the last Cathar finished spitting out his dying venomous curse against Jesus as he burned at the stake before the new priestess of Satan proudly and powerfully raised her terrible head, the witch!But that is a totally different story for another time. Right now we are talking about the Albigensian crusade of the church against its own population in southern France.I mentioned earlier, that southern France was actually the high point of civilization at that time in the whole Western world with its mingling of cultures. It consisted of the cultures of the Christians, of the Arabs, of the the Jewish people and of the Bogomils.PS: I have started a new Facebook discussion group called Organic Gnosticism.

{"content": "IntroductionThe more you want to impact the rest of the world, the less you have to think about others. In fact, the more you want to impact the rest of the world, the more you need to think about yourself.Don\u2019t take that the wrong way, but the cause, effect and drive that ends up creating the outcome of changing a large number of individuals at a global scale, is driven by a tireless machine that\u2019s constantly looking to expand \u2014 the machine known as the individual self, driven to maximize it\u2019s potential.The secret is that you need to continually work on you, more than anything, and not only maximize your potential, but recognize that you have unlimited potential, and continually strive to expand your personal growth so that you:Pick the right craft \u2014 the craft you were born to practice.Become so good you\u2019re able to transcend your field and re-write it\u2019s rules.Arrive at a state I call \u2018voracious enthusiasm\u2019, which transforms the context of your \u2018work\u2019 into riveting fun, which creates an endless drive and energy that makes you hungry to live every moment at your bestRadical commitment to one\u2019s self, or \u2018radical selfishness (in a good way)\u2019 is disguised as \u201cimproving the world\u201d or \u201cserving others\u201d when in fact it\u2019s simple natural selection that drives someone to be so good at something thereby making them feel called as a duty to touch as many people as possible.Elon Musk is so good that he\u2019s able to give back.Mark Zuckerberg is so good that he\u2019s able to give back.But giving back isn\u2019t what drove them to achieve the result that actually creates the giving back.The inner force, drive and everything that makes you (and Zuck and Musk), voraciously enthusiastic, is a selfish one \u2014 a commitment to one\u2019s self.A drive to be excellent.The by-product of that achievement becomes work that reaches people.It starts with a whole hearted commitment to yourself.This isn\u2019t a bad thing and like many terms and concepts, we misunderstand them.And finally \u2014 this isn\u2019t to be a negative piece by any means though I know some will choose to perceive it that way.What Do You Think Drives People to Change The World?What does \u2018changing the world\u2019 even mean?In today\u2019s world, we usually use it in the context of work we do and becoming our best.Do people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk first set out to \u2018change the world\u2019? Or are they on a journey to be their best?In this piece, I explore the drives and motivations of what it\u2019s taken people like Mark Zuckerberg (moving forward referred to as Zuck) and Elon Musk (later referred to as Musk) that gives them the drive and motivation to \u201cconnect the world\u201d for Zuck and \u201csolve mankind\u2019s biggest challenges\u201d for Musk.This piece argues that it\u2019s a combination of a commitment to one\u2019s self, a radical selfishness, that\u2019s committed to maximize it\u2019s own potential, with the by product of it\u2019s impact being how others (the world) adopts it.My Quick Story and Inspiration For the PieceWhen I write something, I feel like I\u2019m on top of the world. It\u2019s an indescribable fire that makes me voracious every second during it\u2019s activity.Driven to read and write, learn and create.Sharing it with others is what makes it meaningful because relationship makes it meaningful. Without relationship to other people, nothing matters.Why? Because the human species is successful because of cooperating in large numbers. If we didn\u2019t have the capacity to cooperate with relationship, natural selection would have killed us long ago.When I\u2019m about to hit publish, I feel as though I\u2019m in outer space, looking at the Earth and physically pushing the globe making a dent in the world.I believe I was born to write and want to do nothing more as I watch myself become my best.This is all the wealth I need, and this is all the wealth Zuck and Musk need.They were never driven by money.Zuck turned down $1 billion without an ounce of doubt and Musk put down his hard earned life savings of $180 million to save his company.I now feel like this and believe this is the cause and creator of the massive impact that I\u2019ll eventually make, with financial representation which will follow.For millennia the sages have said to serve others to make yourself passionate and this has been misunderstood and weakened many emotionally.I don\u2019t say this as a philosophical statement, I say it as a fact.For example, when we hold back to save someone\u2019s feelings, we do them a disservice by not teaching them and generations of people have been affected by it \u2014 myself included until now.Serve others to make yourself committed, they say. That\u2019s a recipe for decay, not evolution\u2014 which is what we\u2019re witnessing in the world today.That is absolutely not to say to not be compassionate or sensitive. Use compassion to be understanding, but more truthful.Use sensitivity, to deliver intelligent communication.We\u2019re wired to survive selfishly first, and serving others facilitates that survival.If we weren\u2019t wired and driven for survival, serving others would serve no purpose and we therefore wouldn\u2019t do it.When we reach this state of self-commitment and see the fruits of it\u2019s labor, life becomes so exciting and fulfilling, and the journey becomes it\u2019s own reward \u2014 voracious enthusiasm itself is the rewarding vehicle.You live each moment and show up each day and you\u2019re time is slowed down because it\u2019s so meaningful.The good news is, when we maximize our potential, we make the biggest impact on others, often for progress and for the better (though this can always be debated) and of course, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are larger than life examples who have changed the world.I\u2019m pointing out their \u2018why\u2019, is not outside (humanity, connecting people) but inside (affect as many as I can, growth to be my best) \u2014 which leads to their most effective and ultimate result.I weave in my own life lessons and how I went from entrepreneurship to writing, and finally provide you the 3 step process that I used, and what pioneering psychologist, Dr. Mihaly Cziksentmihaly prescribes to creating your own \u2018Voracious Enthusiasm\u2019, the inner drive of personal expansion needed to be driven to do something \u2018voraciously\u2019 enough on a daily basis, which is ultimately needed to create something so bold that it changes the world.In this context, I define \u2018voracious\u2019 as a state that\u2019s hungered for, a yearning to exist and get better. It may not be exactly correct. I just happen to love the word and it captures exactly how I feel when I read and write.I don\u2019t want it to end.I gobble up every second.I taste every second like I\u2019m breaking a three day fast.***Also, I am not a \u2018professional\u2019 psychologist or psychiatrist though I\u2019ve read hundreds of books way beyond the basics of what an undergraduate or graduate degree in the subject would give you, and I\u2019ve been coached by a a PHD in organizational psychology for the last two years. I\u2019ll also point out the work experience of hiring and firing over 100 people in a leadership position at a company, leading teams to accomplishing financial goals and leading people to career fulfillment has provided a real world understanding of people\u2019s drives and motivations. So much so that I now coach high performers for a living. Nonetheless, please recognize that this is still just my point of view.***Any breakthrough in science is likely to come from outside the system. \u201cExperts\u201d are the most thoroughly familiar with the developed knowledge inside the prescribed boundaries of a given science. \u2014 Dr. Maxwell Maltz, MD, FICS and author of Psycho-Cybernetics; a pioneering book that\u2019s sold 30 million copies.FirstWhat makes the biggest change agents driven enough to think so big to believe they can change the world in the first place?What makes them believe they\u2019re capable of something so bold as making our massive world of 7 billion people a different place than it was before?What drove Mark Zuckerberg bold to \u201cconnect the world\u201d and what drives Elon Musk to take on humanity\u2019s biggest challenges like energy and outer space?The effect is how you\u2019re doing what you do, and the cause is why.The simple yet profound secret is the local context that transforms what appears to be \u201cworking hard\u201d into the experience of \u201criveting fun\u201d \u2014 voracious enthusiasm.It becomes working each day without working a day in your life.Your work is experienced as an extension of yourself, inspired and excitedly driven to be your best \u2014 using your chosen vocation or craft as a vehicle to maximize your potential at faster and faster rates.When you watch your own growth improve faster and faster, and begin seeing feedback faster and faster, you continue to accelerate personal growth which produces more game changing work that eventually spreads to affect others.This is true because people also share for selfish reasons. Whether it\u2019s word of mouth marketing because they\u2019ve discovered something cool or share an article because it represents what they stand for.Sharing isn\u2019t caring about the other. Sharing is selfish.Natural selection at it\u2019s best. Selfish people selling to selfish people.1. The First Step To Achieving Voracious Enthusiasm\u201cSelfish genes actually explain altruistic individuals, and to me that\u2019s crystal clear.\u201d \u2014Dr. Richard Dawkins; Legendary biologist and author of The Selfish GeneRecognize and embrace your selfishness and appreciate that it\u2019s good for you.This is not a bad thing and need not be suppressed, but rather embraced.We\u2019re selfish organisms wired to survive and are the result of 4 billion years of genetic success. Go with the tide, don\u2019t resist it.Resisting natural selection never works, and is a recipe for failure.Zuckerberg and Musk (and all of us) are fundamentally selfish and aren\u2019t driven by external things like \u2018connecting the world\u2019 as much as we\u2019d like to believe we are.They\u2019re driven intrinsically by emotions that strike deep chords they\u2019ve made meaningful\u2014 mostly based on past suffering (this is common).It\u2019s the result of an inner drive that comes from strong beliefs and their own conviction \u2014 and the confidence to believe that they can pull off ideas so big (whatever they may be) to feed their quest to be their best.Elon Musk can start anything, he\u2019d do it huge.Others may attack the same problem and do it 10,000 times smaller.The only difference, the perception of their size, capacity, belief and confidence.***A quick note: the purpose of the piece isn\u2019t to knock Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or say that all humans are bad because they\u2019re selfish. I\u2019m being factual and pointing out a hard truth I\u2019ve realized recently about human nature. Many people will get hot and bothered by this or say it\u2019s not PC to acknowledge the way I write about these truths. I\u2019m not even saying that we shouldn\u2019t actively change them given our ability as sentient beings blessed with the light of consciousness. What I am saying however is that 95% of our actions are unconscious, and we\u2019re wired and therefore driven by selfishness in general.***Noting further that it was also Dr. Richard Dawkins who said:\u201cLet us try and teach generosity and altruism because we are born selfish. Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to. Because we may then have a chance to upset their designs, something that no other species has ever aspired to do.\u201dBack to our scheduled programming:2. Following Your Individually Unique Inclination \u2014 The Second StepIt Starts Here: You Must Do What You Can\u2019t Not Do\u201cYou possess a kind of inner force that seeks to guide you toward your life\u2019s task. What you are meant to accomplish in the time that you have to live. In childhood, this force was clear to you, it directed you toward activities and subjects that fit your activities and inclinations that sparked a curiosity that was deep and primal. In the intervening years, the force tends to fade in and out as you listen more to parents and peers. This can be the source of your unhappiness. Your lack of connection to who you are and what makes you unique. The first move toward mastery is always inward. Learning who you really are and reconnecting with that innate force. Knowing it with clarity, you will find your way to the proper career path and everything else will fall into place.\u201d Robert Greene, Author of MasteryWhat Green is saying is you\u2019re biologically wired to be great at something and connected to it more than any other activity. This is what makes you genetically unique to the 7 billion other people on the planet, who, a long with you, play a role in the cooperative natural selection process that makes humans the winning species.It\u2019s not about EQ or IQ, but individuality.So everyone\u2019s not smart or dumb. Everyone\u2019s just great at one thing (or type of thing).He quotes the ancient Greek poet Pindar and paraphrases:\u201cYou are born with a particular make up and tendencies that mark you as a piece of fate. It is who you are to the core. Some people never become who they are; they stop trusting in themselves; they conform to the tastes of others, and they end up wearing a mask that hides their true nature. If you allow yourself to learn who you really are by paying attention to that voice and force within you, then you can become what you were fated to become \u2014 an individual, a Master.This force is what celebrates the individual differences in us and was easy to know as a child.It may be an activity you endlessly wondered about or were drawn to you too over the years and has always remained an itch you wanted to scratch.You must be selfish in making this choice of what to commit your life to because it needs to be something you\u2019re exceptional at.You must not feel guilt and push aside the naysayers like parents and peers who tell you to play it safe or take a different path.I did that for four years and it costed me. You must find the courage to follow this calling if you want to tap into the day to day drive and enthusiasm that\u2019s necessary for masterful work and becoming the best.It doesn\u2019t need to be today, or now. Take your time. It took me three different companies to build the confidence and courage to know I need to write.This is why Greene concludes:Becoming Your Best And Changing The WorldBeing the best at what you do in a crowded world requires this deep connection to your craft so your work doesn\u2019t feel like work.Not mentioning, you spend a third of your life \u2018working\u2019, it\u2019s a shame if it\u2019s not fun and enjoyable.It\u2019s hard enough rising above \u201cthe rest\u201d, it takes being connected to your craft to rise above the best.You need every inch, and as we just read, it begins with following that deep inclination and activity that sparks the emotions of love and peace within yourself, which ultimately manifests in your work which others then feel.I\u2019m talking about the 1% or .1%. How do you compete with them?These people work on what they can\u2019t not do.For me, it\u2019s been writing and reading. I can\u2019t not do it.I\u2019ve never been able to during my entrepreneurial journey of five years thus far.There were signs of it as a child, but it lay dormant most of my life. In the early years until not too recently, I was simply focused on following the path that myself and my parents thought was right.There was really nothing else to worry about. Go to college to make money. Call me a late bloomer.I began noticing the writing bug after my first try at a company I\u2019d just shut down. As I was starting my second year of full-time entrepreneurship, I got lost in books, voraciously trying to take in as much as I could.I realized I\u2019d learned so much from even that one experience trying to launch a big idea fast, and could perhaps give back with many of my lessons.I began noticing that writing too me to another place. I began to notice how good at it I was and how fast I was improving.One day, I was walking in the park with my parents dog and got this burning sensation, the \u201cfire in the belly\u201d people talk about.I finally learned what that was and I\u2019d never felt like it before. It took over my entire body. I went home and read and wrote in the deepest flow I\u2019d ever been in. I was so excited about what was happening I couldn\u2019t contain it.I knew I\u2019d discovered something, but in hindsight I didn\u2019t quite know what at the time.That day\u2019s outward manifestation inspired in me the activity of reading and writing. As in, I felt called to immediately go read and write. A thirst for humanity was it\u2019s result, and I wanted to know everything. The insatiable activity I can endlessly do without a moment of it being considered \u2018work\u2019, that inspired insatiable energy all day everyday.The mistake I ended up making from that day was I didn\u2019t channel that calling into myself and that activity, as in, I wasn\u2019t selfish about it.Rather, I channeled it into the other external forces I was already being controlled by.I was all in on the path of fast growth technology start ups, so my takeaway from it was:\u201cI enjoy practicing productivity, personal growth and philosophy, so I should make productivity apps (which evolved into learning software) to help people in the best way I know how.\u201dThough I\u2019m a productivity nerd and love optimizing everything about myself (what I read and write most about), the activity I channeled it to was the wrong one. The activity of selling software to large enterprises didn\u2019t make me voraciously enthusiastic.Had I been called to code (Zuckerberg), perhaps it would have been a different story.It didn\u2019t make me want to tear up each and every day. It still took immense amounts of willpower to show up and that ultimately never lasts if you want to do something that fulfills you each day and brings out your absolute best.So I made two mistakes:One, the activity of selling software wasn\u2019t my uniquely decided talent.Two, I was thinking about \u2018serving others\u2019 incorrectly. I was thinking I need to help people for it\u2019s own sake and that that would make me enthusiastic and voracious about my work each day. But that was incorrect.I need to practice the activity I\u2019m best at and enjoy the most, so I can wake up daily feeling my best so becoming my best for that day becomes the ultimate goal.When this flywheel gains momentum, and you begin expanding at faster and faster rates, you begin to see evidence of the unlimited potential you have within you (and eventually the capacity and belief to create change at a global scale) and your belief of what\u2019s possible goes through the roof.This is what will have me ultimately make the biggest impact on humanity \u2014 maximizing my own potential.I\u2019ve realized not being selfish and doing what\u2019s fatefully mine, has held me back \u2014 and it likely holds others back.And it\u2019s this selfishness that makes the human being have unlimited potential.This is important because this is what makes \u201cwork\u201d enjoyable, and it\u2019s about me (or you).\u201cThe neurochemistry that drives animals to promote their genes is what drives you to care about your legacy. Understanding that is important to your happiness.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Loretta BreuningSo We Know How To Pick Our Activity, But What Creates The Endless Enthusiasm That\u2019s Voracious?Now that we know Mark Zuckerberg is not driven to serve humanity by being motivated to \u201cconnect the world\u201d, how is he driven?When someone says a problem pisses them off so bad, they want to commit themselves to solving it, they\u2019re committing to their own (selfish) emotion.Not because of those who suffer (though re-contextualizing it to touch and impact others does make it meaningful, their intent and drive still comes from overcoming personal challenge and making a difference, for themselves and their fulfillment to live a meaningful life).So the next time someone says they care about the future of humanity and want to make a dent in it for the better, what they don\u2019t know yet or will learn the hard way is they need to do something that\u2019s expansive of themselves first, so they can become good enough for enough people to notice and care.Because others are selfish too.So for Zuckerberg, when he said:What that meant for when he first started Facebook was: \u201cI\u2019m the best coder and maker of software, and girls didn\u2019t like me, so I used that skill to create a site so girls would like me.\u201dThis is well known as Zuck\u2019s initial motivation and it\u2019s not a big deal or uncommon.Most of mens motivation is driven to find a mate, and it\u2019s a huge fear to never attract one.As he evolved and attracting mates was satisfied, he went beyond girls for everyone around him at his college.As he surpassed his college and evolved further, it became all colleges in America.As he surpassed college students across America, he evolved further and it then became \u201cI want to connect the world\u201d which is every great mans primal conquest which is to \u2018leave a legacy\u2019 or \u2018change the world\u2019.This is why Zuckerberg has never worked a day in his life and the best performers never do. They just have voracious enthusiasm and then their primitive nature takes over them to become their best.They\u2019ve found the activity that\u2019s unique to them, which get\u2019s their brain to light up when they\u2019re working, adding and expanding themselves that makes working so much fun and so fulfilling. Every moment is fire and yearning for more.So it appears we work for causes that are greater than ourselves, and we ultimately end up creating something more than just us, but the drive comes from something else.The drive comes from intrinsic selfishness and love for what we\u2019re doing because it makes us feel like we have maximum control, agency and impact over others (the world).Like many, I overcame childhood challenges I carried with me until only recently, and have an obsession with expressing it with writing.I\u2019m writing for myself, but I make it as well and dense as I can so it can touch and impact as many as it can.If you think this is selfish, it is. But it\u2019s required for me to be my best and impact others in the best way I can.If you aren\u2019t doing anything that isn\u2019t exceptionally selfish, you won\u2019t have the voracious enthusiasm required to live a life that\u2019s electric and expansive, every single day.This is why so many corporate workers have a hard time being happy with their work, the structure of corporate enterprises isn\u2019t built for people to expand themselves, it\u2019s built for people to maintain themselves.There\u2019s no room to pushing and expanding to the point people think you\u2019re possessed (you are, in a good way) at a giant company (if you do, everyone will think you\u2019re weird, make fun of you or just wonder why) by doing what you love.People think it\u2019s hard work or talent or luck or any of these things but it\u2019s not.What gave Musk the risk appetite to put his life savings of $180 million on the line he\u2019d just made from a hard earned sale of a company. It\u2019s not for others, its\u2019 for his evolution.I finally decided to follow my calling to read and write and nothing else mattered. The lack of \u2018proper funding runway\u2019 in my bank account, the risk. Nothing mattered.This is all the wealth I\u2019ll ever need.This is what sages have referred to as being \u201ccalled by God\u201d over the Millenia.This is how religious scholars were pushed to serve others by masterfully writing the best religious books then, and this is how Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are driven to build world changing companies now.This is what drives the best founders to work all the time, because it\u2019s not work \u2014 it\u2019s them.This is what makes the best writers read and write all the time, because it\u2019s not work \u2014 it\u2019s them.This is how the best artists, musicians and creators can practice for 10,000 hours. They\u2019ve discovered what they were born to do and be best at, and they never worked a day in their lives, but they sure as hell put in 10,000 hours, because it was for them and they loved every minute of it.3. Find What\u2019s Meaningful To YouThere are a number of ways to arrive at your personal truth.Many are driven by past suffering, or a personal challenge to overcome \u2014 which can be re-contextualized into a hidden gift.We know Zuckerberg did this, and most of us have an issue to overcome.I overcame my small self to be treated how I want to be treated and wrote the most viral article I\u2019ve ever written because of it.My friend was short and proved to the world he was big by becoming a massive business person.I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s ideal, but if there\u2019s a tide, take it.Ta-Nehisi Coates changed my life after this talk at the New York Public Library \u2014 I was so pissed at the injustice against blacks he talked about.I\u2019m now writing film scripts and tv screenplays to eradicate the problem because of the painful emotion it brings out of me.An emotion I want to channel into my own work to affect others.Overcoming suffering or connecting with others suffering, and re-contextualizing it to overcome is a common way to live a voracious life through voracious work.In his pioneering book, Flow, the Psychology of Optimal Experience, Dr. Mihaly Cziksentmihaly suggests:Acknowledging that suffering or trauma, even in childhood, has a hidden gift in it. It\u2019s your job to interpret it as a possible challenge, thereby embracing it to better yourself. This gives you purpose. Then you recognize there\u2019s a whole world of others out there just like you who suffer from the same problems. It becomes your mission to become your best so you can impact others who have your problems.Cziksentmihaly calls it \u2018dissipative structuring\u2019, the ability to draw order from disorder.He further suggests: \u201cThe challenge then becomes generalized to other people or to mankind as a whole.\u201dHe provides a beautiful story of an (anonymous) successful and high profile person who suffered as a child he called \u201cE\u201d.E\u2019s parents came to America with nothing but their dreams and were financially poor. On his 7th birthday, they bought him a bicycle.One day while riding it, he was hit by a car by a wealthy doctor. The doctor promised to cover the hospital bills if his father didn\u2019t report it to the police. His father, not really having a choice other than to believe the doctor, agreed. The doctor disappeared and was nowhere to be found. E\u2019s father was forced into debt and never recovered becoming an alcoholicCziksentmihaly continues to say:\u201cThis event could have been a trauma that left it\u2019s scar on E. Forever, turning him into a cynic who would from now on look out for his own self-interest no matter what. Instead, E. drew a curious lesson from his experience. He used it to create a life theme that not only gave meaning to his own life, but helped reduce entropy (helplessness) in the experience of many others. He decided to become a lawyer, not only to better his own life, but to make certain that injustices such as he had suffered would not occur so easily again to others in his position. Once he had set this goal for himself, his resolution was unwavering.\u201dE ended up becoming a leading attorney, and then a judge who became an aid to the President of the United States who fought for civil rights policy and legislation for immigrants and minorities.Dr. Cziksentmihaly concludes:\u201cE\u2019s example illustrates several common characteristics of how people forge discovered life themes. In the first place, the theme is in many cases a reaction to a great personal hurt suffered in early life. To being orphaned, abandoned or being treated unjustly.The external event never determines what the theme will be. What matters is the interpretation (and meaning) that one places on the suffering.\u201cSo the next question is, what kinds of explanations are one\u2019s suffering lead to negentropic life themes? If a child abused by a violent father concluded that the problem was inherent in human nature, and all men were weak and violent, there would not be much he or she could do about it.On the other hand, to find purpose in suffering one must interpret it as a possible (personal) challenge, which becomes generalized to other people or mankind as a whole. In E\u2019s case, formulating his problem as being due to the helplessness of disenfranchised minorities, and not to his father\u2019s faults. E was then able to develop the appropriate skills to confront the challenges he saw at the root of what had been wrong in his personal life. Thus, whatever solution he found to his own problems would benefit not only himself, but many others besides. This altruistic way of generalizing solutions is typical of negentropic (positive interpretation) life themes brings harmony to the lives of many.\u201dConclusionThis is why so many people are driven to succeed. If you want to become your best and change the world, the first step is to start telling the hard truth.What can you can\u2019t not do?What brings out your best?Why do you want to change the world?The answers are neither good or bad, they\u2019re just the conditions that make us human.For Mark Zuckerberg, it started with coding to get girls. Now it\u2019s to connect the whole world.For me, it\u2019s writing and proving myself to the world.What Is It For You?Our wiring and sophisticated minds come up with all kinds of ways to assign meaning to events.If you want to change the world like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk did, it starts by living with voracious enthusiasm, a state that makes every moment electric and exciting \u2014 where it\u2019s never work, because it\u2019s all about growing yourself.You\u2019re driven to maximize your potential which only get\u2019s pushed to higher and higher levels the faster and faster you grow.Your ideas get bigger than you do and you begin to impact more and more people.But know this, the more people you impact, the less you need to think about their potential, and the more you need to think about maximizing yours.Work this way and you\u2019ll have so much fun so changing the world won\u2019t even matter.It\u2019s these people who get lucky to wake up one day and realize they\u2019ve changed the world like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg.Art by Juan JiminezArt by Juan JiminezThanks for reading.

{"content": "I began my short term (sometimes business related, sometimes not) travelling adventures a little over two years ago, and by now I have visited about 20 countries, met amazing people, saw some great places and never regretted going on every single one of these trips.There are countless opportunities for these types of adventures (ranging from workshops, conferences, summer schools, winter schools etc), all it takes is some googling, persistence and patience. During the last two years I\u2019ve accumulated many experiences from the trips I took, so I will share five key points that I managed to single out.1. The best things in life are fully (or partially) coveredWhen you are working and living in Eastern Europe, when it comes to travelling there are two important factors that determine whether you will have the opportunity to do it often or not \u2014 time and money. Most of the time you either lack time OR money, so you need to a find a mechanism that works well with both (if possible).After struggling to travel anywhere for three years since I started working as a journalist for a local news agency, and barely having saved any money to do so, I said to myself that there must be another way.Then I started searching and researching\u2026 And I thought, why not combine my professional interests with my travelling ones? So I started applying for training conferences, workshops, fellowships, forums\u2014 whatever I could find. The beauty of it all is that as soon as you get accepted to participate \u2014 most of them are fully or partially covered, so you do not have to spend the money that you don\u2019t have \u2014 by precisely doing that!In most cases everything about these trips is covered \u2014 from travel expenses, accommodation and food, so you only need to bring \u2018just in case\u2019 money.2. Once you start, there is no stoppingI had my first travel experience like this back in April 2014 in Brussels, and at the time I said to myself that if I manage to do it once every six months \u2014 that would be awesome! Boy, was I wrong. During 2015 I had two trips, maintaining the tempo, but constantly craving for more.Last year, I managed to have 12 short-term trips (ranging from 2\u20133 days to a week) \u2014 basically one per month\u2026 And I still think that I could have had done more traveling.Once the wanderlust takes hold of you, it\u2019s not something that can be switched on and off. Often you will find yourself planning for next trip after you\u2019ve just completed your last one.3. You meet extra-ordinary people and build lifelong relationshipsDuring the last two years on my trips I\u2019ve come across some extraordinary and amazing people \u2014 people that I would otherwise never have met if I stayed at home. Whether I am talking about Christoph from Berlin, Marta from Lviv, Zanele from Swazilend or Lyla from Gongju \u2014 the list could go on and on \u2014 everyone that I have met on this journey has changed me in a different way and made me a better person.With some of the people you get to build lifelong friendships and relationships, with others you just don\u2019t \u2014 doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re talking about online of offline relationships, and whether you will see them in person again or not.In fact, with the constant traveling I did last year I got to see more of my international friends than my \u2018domestic\u2019 ones. When it comes to meeting people when abroad \u2014 you just need to keep an open mind and trust me, you won\u2019t regret it!4. Be ready for everythingThe two years have been one crazy ride, as I\u2019ve stayed from youth hostels in Vukovar, Novi Sad and Sarajevo, to luxurious hotels in London, Berlin and Seoul. My experiences differed only because of the people that I met on the trips \u2014 the quality of the accommodation never played an important part for me. Of course, it\u2019s extremely nice to be a five star hotel, but don\u2019t limit your expectations and let them define your experience.I also learned that you must always give a chance to new and unknown destinations. Sure, it\u2019s always great to visit Paris, London and Barcelona, but don\u2019t be skeptical about going to Vukovar, Odessa or Rostov-on-Don too. If there weren\u2019t for these programs, I admit that visiting those cities would probably be the last thing on my mind.However, since experiencing these places, now I am open to visiting more and more little known destinations throughout Europe and the world.5. It\u2019s always hard when you return back homeThe hard part of is actually returning home. Post-travel depression always hits you bad, especially if you don\u2019t have any upcoming trips planned ahead. I still haven\u2019t found a way to cope with these feelings.The closest to what can be seen as a solution for this crisis, is to try and write about your experiences \u2014 and to share them not only as a motivation for others, but for yourself as well.Clap or share if you like this article, and let me know what are the things you have learned from traveling, would be great to hear your experiences!", "id": 6, "title": "Five Things I\u2019ve Learned from Short-Term Travelling"}	
{"content": "Either I\u2019ve become way better at choosing which books to read, or am able to get more out of reading each individual book than I used to. In any case, a surprisingly large number of books have managed to contribute long lasting ideas to my mental repertoire over the last couple of years, compared to years prior. Here\u2019s my brief summary of a few of them. This is not so much an indiscriminate compilation of reviews as much as a ringing endorsement of a handful of the books I read. You\u2019ll probably notice some common themes running through the list. I haven\u2019t added any negative comments about these books because they wouldn\u2019t tilt the balance of my recommendation.Deep Work by Cal NewportI first read this as soon as it came out, in early 2016. And re-read it again this year. It has many solid ideas, all based on the assumption that success in intellectual careers of the unfolding future depends on doing extremely mentally demanding tasks (\u201cdeep work\u201d) on a regular basis. Therefore, the author \u2014 who has a PhD in theoretical computer science from MIT \u2014 suggests that you should organize your life around a work routine which enables that style of work. You can take inspiration from a variety of people and professions who already operate in that manner, and you should avoid bad habits like multitasking, over use of social media.I\u2019ve managed to incorporate some ideas from this book into my work life over the last couple of years and observed good results. Off the top of my head I can list the following: allocating big blocks of time in my calendar for deep work, conserving precious willpower to be able to take on such work, cutting down on social media, seeking out silence and solitude, and letting my mind actually feel bored at times so that it gets used to a lack of stimulation.I\u2019ve restricted my summary to just a couple of paragraphs, but Newport goes into elaborate detail on what is meant by deep work, why its economic value is at an inflection point, and how he himself manages his intellectual energies. He has some proof of success in his productive academic career so far. I feel that every knowledge worker is going to find enough things that resonate within this book, and hopefully go on to try some of his tips.2. The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods by A. G. SertillangesThis early 20th Century book by a Christian monk is referenced in Deep Work. It extends Newport\u2019s economic value proposition of intellectual work into a broader philosophy of life, probably one more suited to academics and theologians of the author\u2019s ilk. What\u2019s pertinent is that many of us are trending towards leading such a life in today\u2019s intellectual climate, without being consciously aware of the fact. The author draws upon his own life experience, but one that is also rooted in hundreds of years of monastic practice. Thus, the book contains many subtle psychological nuggets, refined over time and presented in beautifully simple English.For example: he believes there are 4 reasons to \u201cread\u201d, and warns you not to over indulge. The reasons being:for formation \u2014 books of lasting impact that are about values, habits, attitudes etc. Obviously, they will be few in number.for information \u2014 think of this as very specific documentation about work related tasks.for enlightenment \u2014 general reading like newspapers and magazines to remain clued in to the world around you. Recommended in moderation.for entertainment \u2014 probably made more sense before TV, video and social media. He has strong injunctions against over indulging in novels. How quaint!I use this categorization whenever I find myself browsing mindlessly. It\u2019s easy to fool oneself into thinking you are not reading for entertainment. So being able to assign a specific category to the material at hand can act as a check. The book delves into his Christian belief system on occasion, but not so often as to detract from the core content of an intellectual life.3. A Mind for Numbers by Barbara OakleyThis innocuous little book, based on a popular online course by the author, packs a powerful punch. Despite the title, it\u2019s not just about mathematics. Oakley presents a credible \u2014 enough for me! \u2014 theory of how the brain accumulates knowledge, retains it and recalls it. Expertise that is demonstrated through flashes of insight also fit into this theory. Based on this, Oakley suggests routines and practices that help you learn faster, recall better and of course, apply it to get crucial insights.If the ideas in this book have any academic merit, I dearly hope they become part of the common vocabulary of students of all ages and kinds. Phrases like focused / diffused modes of thinking, chunking, active recall (as opposed to re-reading), spaced repetition, will power fatigue etc need to be on everyone\u2019s lips in order to create a more productive society. Perhaps these ideas have already made it into mainstream pedagogy but they\u2019ve been lost in translation? I don\u2019t know. But personally I\u2019ve had good success using these concepts when learning and solving problems. I create time for focused thinking, recall concepts as I go about my daily chores, figure out what chunks best abstract a piece of information, and so on.The book is not a dry, theoretical walkthrough, largely because it was motivated by the author\u2019s own emotional journey back into a STEM degree, after having been a miserable failure at mathematics in school. She also cites famous people from the worlds of physics, medicine, art and so on who applied these practices although they didn\u2019t name them as such. And a few of them happened to be borderline academic failures, just like Oakley herself!4. Peak by Anders Ericsson and Talent is Overrated by Geoff ColvinQuite frankly, I\u2019m surprised that I hadn\u2019t come across Anders Ericsson\u2019s work till now! Apparently, Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s popular book \u201cOutliers\u201d goes over some of his territory, but in this new book Ericsson calls out Gladwell for misrepresenting some of his core ideas. Ericsson\u2019s thesis is that the way to become an expert at any skill is to follow a style of practice he calls \u201cdeliberate practice\u201d. A consistent application of deliberate practice over years can bring you within reach of world class performers in that field. Notice that the stunning corollary to that is that genetics and natural talents play a far less role in virtuosity than generally believed. And also, expertise is not automatically transferable across domains, unless they happen to share some common underlying concepts.Ericsson is a psychologist who has been studying various kinds of experts \u2014 in particular how they acquire their skills \u2014 for many decades. Consequently, he has a lot of affirming evidence and presents it in a measured writing style that still manages to be engaging. He fearlessly breaks down the myth of genius around people like Mozart, Benjamin Franklin, modern musicians, Tiger Woods, chess grandmasters, marathon winners, memory champions etc.So what is deliberate practice? First you break down the skill to be acquired into distinct, objective components that are measurable during practice sessions. Then you go about working on each component \u2014 separately if required \u2014 in a series of exercises designed to push you out of your current comfort zone. It\u2019s vital that you get continuous feedback as you practice (preferably from an onsite coach), so that you can make adjustments as you go along. Practice of this nature is mentally taxing and can\u2019t be kept up for more than a few hours at a stretch. Musicians who work in this manner, for example, take a deep nap immediately after.If you keep practising in this manner, your mental representation of the skill keeps getting more refined and easier to recall. Finally, the different components come together in one fluid motion. Ericsson ventures into some brain studies as well, showing how people with advanced ability in certain fields \u2014 London cab drivers who have detailed knowledge of the city, for example \u2014 develop a different pattern of brain cells over time.All of this is fascinating stuff, and one hopes that Ericsson\u2019s findings aren\u2019t disproved at their core. The catch of course, is coming up with those specific set of exercises and mental representations that correspond to each skill.Geoff Colvin is a popular journalist who has interpreted Ericsson\u2019s work for the layperson. His book predates Ericsson\u2019s by a few years, but hits roughly the same notes and in a fairly accurate manner. It features more anecdotes and first person interviews than the former. Colvin also allows himself to speculate more widely about the nature of expertise.If you read both these books (and like me, the closely related one called The Talent Code), you begin to sense their far-reaching implications. On an individual level, it shows clearly that you can improve far more than you think \u2014 in whatever you choose to work on \u2014 provided you allocate sufficient time and energy to such deliberate practice. If the broader worlds of education and business are viewed through this lens, they suddenly appear very Darwinian. Today we do a good job of spotting talent and nurturing it, but offer little by way of hope to the shocking proportion of people who prematurely self-select out of even trying to master complex subjects. This could be remedied to a large extent.5. The Startup of You by Reid HoffmanCompared to the rest of the lot, this book is a swashbuckling ride. You get to see Hoffman\u2019s version of what lies behind successful careers. Hoffman \u2014 as many might know \u2014 was one of the founders of LinkedIn and in this book he radiates genuine affection when giving specific and actionable career advice. His premise is that the era of stable jobs that have well-defined career trajectories is over, and today you must treat your career the way an entrepreneur treats their startup (hence the title). At its core, this means you always consider your professional identity as being a work-in-progress (what he terms \u201cpermanent beta\u201d) and be willing to adapt.Fundamentally, what you should be working on is developing your competitive advantage, as that is what makes your customer (or in this case your employer) choose you over others. He says that competitive advantage is a function of the following things: market realities, your abilities, and your aspirations or values. Always keep an eye out for whether the market for your expertise is on the up or down. Significantly, this is independent of whatever your current employer is paying you for those same skills. Similarly, you should be assessing your abilities and introspecting about your values.Based on what such assessment tells you, create one main, ambitious plan of action for career progress and set that as your current default. At the same time, have a less ambitious one as the back up, and then a place of refuge that lets you stay solvent if things go horribly wrong. If you are operating with this conscious objective of increasing your competitive advantage, it might also be that a \u201cbreakout\u201d opportunity \u2014 which can accelerate it tremendously \u2014 might serendipitously present itself, and you will be well poised to capitalize on it. He believes that people with remarkable careers usually took advantage of at least one such breakout opportunity. But without an acute awareness of your competitive advantage, market realities and so on you are unlikely to even notice such chances. He adds that your plan shouldn\u2019t be too detailed or project too far into the future. A couple of steps ahead from where you currently are, is a good rule of thumb.My description of the book\u2019s contents so far might make it seem a tad abstract, but it is anything but. Hoffman is quite the Silicon Valley insider and has had long friendships with top tier executives and venture capitalists. So all this advice is backed up with credible anecdotes from companies like Paypal, Zynga, Draper Ventures and others.By far the best part of the book is Hoffman\u2019s thoughts on the value of a professional network (he says it is \u201cI to the power We\u201d) and his recommendations for creating your own. He is brilliant at framing related issues. For example, his notion of allies, strong and \u201cweak connections\u201d is something to keep in mind as you get to know more people over your lifetime. He acknowledges that people with successful careers always operated in an enabling environment, and goes as far as saying the \u201cYou\u201d in the book\u2019s title refers to the set of people who make the individual you a success.Most repositories of information \u2014 including this article! \u2014 sit there passively once created, only leaving you with a few faint mental images after you are done reading them. No book can by itself pop out of your shelf on a Saturday morning and give you a rap on the knuckles for failing to follow through. Hoffman tries to address this partly, by providing exercises at the end of each chapter and exhorting you to make a plan, schedule meetings with people you think you should talk to, and so on.6. So Good They Can\u2019t Ignore You by Cal NewportNewport gets an encore on the list, thanks to his assiduous nature. When he was about to finish his Ph.D and find a job, he started researching about careers, and true to form wrote a book on the topic. He locates the book inside a somewhat contrarian outlook, done partly to garner attention (according to his own admission). He wants people who are starting out on their careers to stop thinking of \u201cfollowing their passion\u201d and instead focus on acquiring \u201crare and valuable\u201d skills. Passion is often a result of having useful skills and being able to deploy them satisfactorily. It is neither necessary \u2014 nor sufficient \u2014 to be passionate about something before developing related skills.Newport believes in a craftsman-like approach to work, where you progressively get better at a task, and derive happiness by good execution. This may not appeal to someone who has grand visions like address injustice in society, tackle climate change etc. Newport\u2019s response to that comes in the form of a long segment at the end, called the \u201cMission driven life\u201d. He believes that it is perfectly fine to have lofty goals, but don\u2019t assume that will let you skip the phase of acquiring concrete skills. Also, it sometimes happens that worthwhile missions only become clear after you\u2019ve gained some expertise. An extreme case is of graduate students who embark on a Ph.D but soon find themselves disillusioned due to a lack of exciting ideas. The missing link here is an extensive knowledge of their field, which is a prerequisite for generating good ideas at the forefront.But the rest of the book is more broadly applicable. How the quest for passion in a person too young can lead to looking inwards for non-existent answers, rather than looking outwards at society and figuring out what needs doing. It also leads to loss of valuable time that could have been otherwise spent acquiring skills. Newport draws on quite a few anecdotes, studies and books. Some of them do feel far-fetched (like an archaeologist who went on to host a TV show), and you could argue that there are enough people to be found who are competent but never had a fulfilling career. But on the whole, his suggestions feel sound to me. For example, Steve Jobs is famous for preaching the \u201cfollow your passion\u201d mantra, but he himself took his time to figure out what his \u201cpassion\u201d was, and it was more the success of the initial computer sales that made him decide to commit to that business, rather than any great childhood interest in computers.Which brings me to what is arguably the best part of the book: a specific strategy for deciding on your plan of action, that Newport calls the \u201clittle bets\u201d approach. While Hoffman stresses on the power of networks and conversations, Newport relies on experiments. First you should identify a handful of promising future directions, and then for each possibility, commit to doing small projects within a fixed time frame. This generates real feedback, and avoids wishful thinking and various other cognitive biases. He has been using this approach to determine which research ideas deserve further investment.Hoffman and Newport have different ways of going about things. Hoffman looks like the inveterate hustler, always believing that with enough networking and pivoting you will arrive at better outcomes. Newport is more internally focused (an entire chapter is devoted to \u201cthe clarity of the craftsman\u201d) and places more value on expertise gained over time, preferably in solitude. The way I\u2019d like to reconcile the two is by noting where each is appropriate. There is a time and place for hustling, and similarly for hunkering down and doing the grind associated with tackling mentally demanding problems. Being able to do both could dramatically improve your productivity.7. The Road to Character by David BrooksIt\u2019s hard to believe that I read this book just a little over a year ago, as its contents have worked their way broadly and deeply into my psyche. You can read my detailed review from back then, but what has found repeated echo to me over the last year is the idea that people can traverse long and surprising arcs over their lives. It is Brooks\u2019 own rendering of the \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d and some other aspects of behavioural psychology. What I wrote then about reaching across the aisle continues to remain relevant. As society continues to diversify and individuals live within their respective attention bubbles, common ground will recede. So you can\u2019t hold that a person\u2019s views on any one issue is definitive of their overall belief system, nor that their beliefs won\u2019t change over time. Applied to oneself, the book provides many cautionary tales of moral and sensual pitfalls which are ever present and require diligent effort to overcome.", "id": 7, "title": "Influential books I read in the last 2 years"}

Get control of your credit card debt! Pay off your student loans!\u2014you need to take a good, honest look at the wounds you\u2019ve inflicted on your budget. Chase Slate Financial Education Ambassador Farnoosh Torabi is here to help you rip off the Band-Aid. Promise: This will only hurt a little.\nThere\u2019s almost nothing less fun than looking over your bank statements and realizing you spent $150 on lattes last month. That\u2019s probably why so many of us avoid looking at our statements at all, unless something\u2019s obviously wrong\u2014we\u2019d rather not be reminded of the damage we\u2019re doing. But it all adds up, and even seemingly insignificant expenses (like that daily $5 matcha break) may be more of a problem than you realize. If you\u2019re determined to make 2018 the year you finally achieve the goals you\u2019ve been focused on for so long (#adulting), you\u2019re going to want to detoxify your spending habits\u2014just like you\u2019d cut back on sugar or alcohol after a month filled with cookie baking and boozy holiday parties. Yes, it\u2019s hard work up front, but if you\u2019re looking to tackle a major life change\u2014whether that\u2019s buying a house, or getting out of debt, or going to grad school\u2014you need money to make it happen. Here\u2019s how to make sure every dime you earn is helping get you to a better place.\n1. Sweat the details\nThe first step, as daunting as it may seem, is to figure out where every penny you earn is going right now. That means printing out your credit card and bank statements (yes, every single one of them), grabbing a notepad, and diving in. Create two columns: \u201cneeds\u201d and \u201cwants.\u201d Anything that falls into the \u201cneeds\u201d category is a non-negotiable: housing, car insurance, debt repayments. \u201cWants\u201d are things like travel, clothes, dining out, and your souped up smartphone. As you go down the line, be on the lookout for surprises in both categories\u2014you\u2019ve probably forgotten about some of the things you\u2019re paying for. (I recently realized I was still paying $10 a month for Gogo inflight WiFi, which I meant to cancel once the free trial was over. It happens!) The most important thing here is to be honest about what it is you really need. You need a cell phone to stay in touch with friends and family and to stay on top of things at work, but do you really need an iPhone X? One need that often goes overlooked: your savings. You should be devoting around 20 percent of your take-home pay to savings and debt repayment. If you aren\u2019t quite there, or if you\u2019d like to go above and beyond in the pursuit of a particular goal, free up some funds by looking for changes you can make to both your \u201cwants\u201d and your \u201cneeds.\u201d \n2. Cut it out\nIt is possible to spend less on the essentials without making huge lifestyle changes. If there isn\u2019t much left over for savings once you pay your rent or your mortgage, think about getting a \u201csometimes\u201d roommate\u2014that is, use Airbnb to rent your spare bedroom out to travelers, or your entire apartment if you\u2019re going to be out of town. That could net you hundreds of dollars every month. Or if your credit card payments feel like too much of a burden, see if you can transfer your balance to a card with 0 percent APR (that means you may not have to pay interest on what you owe for a year or more).\nCutting back on the non-essentials is much easier. Food is a necessity, but is ordering Seamless every night a necessity? Probably not. Give yourself a couple of evenings off each week for delivery or dinners out with friends, but the rest of the time, commit to cooking (or assembling, if that\u2019s more your speed). You could save $50, $60, or even close to $100 each week just by packing your lunch every day. \n3. Do the (side) hustle\nIf you\u2019ve pared down your expenses and you\u2019re still feeling squeezed, you\u2019re going to want to look into making more money. I promise it\u2019s not as hard as it sounds, and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to march into your boss\u2019 office and demand a raise right this second. Instead, make like the estimated 34 percent of Americans who take part in the gig economy.\nThere are now more ways than ever to monetize your talents or to make money off the stuff you already own. If you love animals, try pet-sitting a couple of times a month through a site like Rover.com. Have a car? Sign up with a service like TaskRabbit (you need to submit an application and attend an orientation to join) and help neighbors run errands or haul furniture. It\u2019s kind of cool to learn to juggle multiple income streams, and some people find they really enjoy thinking like an entrepreneur\u2014so much so that they decide to turn their side gigs into full-time jobs. \n4. Know the score\nTaking stock of your money habits involves more than just combing through your bank statements. Understanding your credit profile (AKA your credit score and your credit report) can get you a long way towards achieving your goals. If you want to buy a car, or a home, or do anything that requires taking out a loan, your credit rating matters a lot. It\u2019s going to determine whether you qualify for more credit, and what kinds of interest rates will be attached to the credit you do qualify for. The higher your score\u2014if it\u2019s above 750, you\u2019re in good shape\u2014the more likely you\u2019ll be to earn a lower interest rate, which ultimately means more money in your pocket. A difference of even just half a percentage point on an interest rate can save you hundreds (or even thousands) of dollars over the course of your loan. There are a number of easy, free ways to keep tabs on your credit score. You\u2019re legally entitled to a free copy of your credit report each year from each of the three major credit bureaus; sites like AnnualCreditReport.com make it easy to sign up for all three reports in one place. For a more immediate sense of your standing, some credit cards\u2014like Chase Slate, for instance\u2014give customers access to a credit dashboard, where they can check their credit scores as often as they want for free. \n5. Set it, but don\u2019t forget it\nYou\u2019ve figured out how much money you have coming in and exactly how much you can afford to part with each month. The biggest challenge now? Staying on track. Use technology to your advantage by automating your monthly bills and leaning on an app or a website to keep tabs on how well (or not) you\u2019re sticking with the rules you set out for yourself. You Need a Budget is a popular one\u2014it links to your accounts and assigns every dollar that comes in a \u201cjob,\u201d which takes a lot of the guesswork out of it. Full disclosure: After your initial free trial period, the software costs $6.99 per month, but it\u2019s worth the investment.\n7/8\n6. Ask, and you might receive\nYou should never be afraid to ask for a break. Those surprise Gogo WiFi charges I saw on my statement recently? I called and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize I was still paying for this. Is there anything you can do?\u201d Those are the key words: \u201cIs there anything you can do?\u201d I didn\u2019t get a full refund, but customer service gave me back the cost of three of the six months I\u2019d paid. If you have a car, look at how much you\u2019re paying for car insurance. It could be worth it to call your insurance company and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not driving as much as I used to because I work from home once a week now.\u201d Or, \u201cI have a really good track record. Can you do better?\u201d There are so many competing agencies out there, some of which may be able to offer up a better rate. If yours won\u2019t come down, it may be time to switch. 8/8\n7. Phone a friend\nIt\u2019s really important not to budget in a silo. Let your friends and family know you\u2019re trying to spend less and save more; that way, they\u2019re aware that this is a priority for you and can offer up the support you need. (It may even inspire them to start doing the same.) And, if you can, find a budget buddy\u2014sort of like a workout buddy, but for your money. Commit to checking in with one another every few weeks and swap tips. They\u2019ll help hold you accountable; you\u2019ll help hold them accountable; and you\u2019ll both be that much closer to living the lives you want and deserve.\nFarnoosh Torabi is one of America\u2019s leading personal finance authorities.

{"content": "When things get tough or simply flat, many people turn to a motivational article for a bit of inspiration and extra thrill. From hairdresser to famous fashion blogger, from nerdish ordinary man to successful entrepreneur: those are the kind of stories we love to read when we need to nurture our own motivation.Here at Friendz we believe that a real inspiring experience comes from the courage to overturn the status quo and exit the personal comfort zone. Nothing to do with a jump from anonymity to public recognition. We consider extraordinary those people who dare to break their schemes, like leaving a desk in the Dublin headquarter of Google to invest their effort in an Italian startup in Milan, for example.Incredible, right?In our office, during the coffee break, we met the person that abandoned a pint of Guinness beer for us and we submersed him with tons of questions.F: Hi Enrico, welcome to the Friendz Family! Introduce yourself before we get started!E: Hi everybody! My name is Enrico Pasquotti, 31 years old and I am the one who was crazy enough to leave a safe and prestigious steady job for a new adventure!F: Let\u2019s talk business now! As I find out that somebody from Google was joining us, a question came to my mind: what kind of motivations drove you to the decision of leaving the most prestigious company in the world to undertake a new career in a startup?E: Fair enough! I am quite familiar with answering this question!I joined Google in 2014. I was entering the company named best place to work for 6 years in a row (2011\u20132017). I was obviously happy and excited to meet talented people and keen to learn as much as I could there. And I did: the environment in Google was actually amazing and I met wonderful people. I learnt a lot initially.After a while I felt I was having stronger impact on people rather than business: I was not growing as I wanted to do and the learning curve was, of course, reaching the end of the exponential rise and its limit.I experienced myself how true is the quote \u201cit\u2019s better to have an amazing career in an average company than an average career in an amazing company\u201d.That\u2019s when I started looking for new opportunities where I could apply my skills and bring real added value.F: How did you find out about us?E: I believe that nothing in life is casual as it might seem. Friendz has been introduced to me by a good friend which I met while I was working at Boston Consulting Group. As it often happens, the best opportunities come from your network, the interesting persons you really choose, not those you randomly meet. I really believe, in fact, that to be successful in the personal and professional life, everybody needs to invest time in people, cultivating acquaintances in the workplace, not just concentrating in delivering results.Returning back to my colleague at BCG, one day he sent me an email with Cecilia, one of the founder of Friendz, in CC. The content of the message was, more or less, this: \u201cEnrico wants to change life and he is interested in kicking a startup. Friendz sounds like the perfect match for him!\u201d.From that moment on, I started to get in touch with the Friendz world. I still remember the first time when Daniele, Alessandro and Cecilia came to Dublin to convince me, with all their enthusiasm, to join their team while having lunch in Google canteen!F: And now tell us, how did the founders finally persuade you to jump on-board? What did motivate you to join Friendz?E: Actually, there were two main reasons why I decided to shake my entire life to follow this crazy idea! The first one is that I loved Friendz attitude and energy since the beginning! During the first weeks, I immersed myself in this family and I really understood how the company was working. It can be summarized in 2 words: accountability and direct communication. The second reason that made me choose Friendz was a more strategic one: I saw a huge potential in the startup, I loved its vision and I saw in it a great opportunity for global scalability. Not to be mention, the idea of approaching this expansion through an ICO!F: Yes you are right! We haven\u2019t mention the ICO project yet. Would you like to tell us more details about how does it work and its importance for Friendz?E: The ICO project was definitely something that caught my attention. While being in Dublin I was a great passionate of social media and cryptocurrencies, from the most technical to the most inspirational ones. I\u2019ve studied the topic and invested myself in some other ICOs. Hence, I got a hint of what were the features that made it successful or not.Friendz convinced me for the coin offer: I remember I thought that there couldn\u2019t have been a better environment for a cryptocurrency. The founders\u2019 vision was, in addition, an inevitable plus: in their ambitious dream, they were seeing Friendz not just as a small company but as a world leader in the communication sector. I loved the enthusiasm they were dedicating to transform what was an Italian startup in an international reality through the ICO process, something that is definitely new in our country.Hence, here I am, working side to side with them to make the dream come true.F: Enrico, you told us you will be leading the project of Friendz globalization. Do you already have a strategy in mind? Moreover, what do you think will be the challenges you will face and the factors that will make this process smoother?E: Good questions! As I told you, I really value the network of acquaintances I made through my past working experience and I am convinced that between them there are already hidden a bunch of potential future collaborators. And since people are important, in Friendz we will invest in recruiting the best talents, aligned with our company philosophy, to spread our values around the world. In the next future, in fact, I picture Friendz not as a soulless multinational company but as a global reality which is still loyal to its core principles.In this regard, within 2018 our plan is to bring Friendz in the principal European markets, proceeding with the expansion in America and Asia in the following years.To do so, we will open branches in the countries where our strategy will fit the best, establishing connection and empowering our network. Luckily enough, I\u2019m not doing everything by myself: I work side by side with great professionists that will make this expansion smoother. By the way, we have just opened our first office abroad, in Spain, and things are going wonderfully!An aspect to be taken into consideration is that we will need to be continuously updated with the evolution of the technology that will enable us to globally scale our business. But we are not scared: despite everything, if we are investing all of our energy in this project of expansion it is because we strongly believe in it. The use of a cryptocurrency is an added value for Friendz and it will accelerate the app international launch! I am also convinced that an increased degree of interests towards our services will be linked with an increased value of our coin, resulting in a higher purchasing-possibility of the same. I am so confident about the success of this project that I cannot wait to share with you the first success. Let\u2019s keep in touch for the updates!Enrico, the king of GoogleWelcome Enrico to our family!Enrico's avatar :)", "id": 10, "title": "Leaving Google for Friendz: how we did handle the miracle"}
